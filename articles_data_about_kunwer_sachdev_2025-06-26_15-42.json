        "content": "Kunwer Sachdev\n\nMy journey as an entrepreneur has been anything but ordinary. I never set out to build a multi-million-dollar company, nor did I have a blueprint for success. What I had was an insatiable curiosity, an unyielding determination, and the belief that problems exist only to be solved. Even at the age of 15, I started selling pens to shopkeepers with my brother, which gave me my first experience of sales, a skill that proved invaluable throughout my career.https://kunwersachdev.com/mr-kunwer-sachdev-the-inverter-man-of-india-journey/\n\nI started my career in theCable TV business, learning the ropes of entrepreneurship through sheer experience. I had no formal education in technology or business, yet I was fascinated by how things worked—how signals were transmitted, how machines functioned, how innovation could change lives. This curiosity became my biggest strength.\n\nIt was this same curiosity that led me to the world of power backup solutions. In the early days, people in India struggled withfrequent power cuts.Inverters and batteries were unreliable, inefficient, and often made with outdated technology. I saw a gap, an opportunity to create something better. With no background in electronics, I immersed myself in learning, experimenting, and innovating, and that’s howSu-Kam was born.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam was not easy. There were challenges at every step—from R&D and manufacturing to sales and service. But I believed in the power of perseverance and innovation. We introduced India’s first MOSFET-based inverter, India’s first DSP-based inverter, and many other groundbreaking technologies that changed the face of the industry.Su-Kam became more than just a company; it became a revolution. We not only built inverters, UPS systems, and solar solutions but also trained thousands of professionals, setting industry benchmarks.\n\nHowever, life has its twists and turns. Despite all the success, I had to step away from Su-Kam. But true passion never fades, and for me, innovation is not just about business—it is about making a difference. I knew my journey wasn’t over. That’s whenSu-vastika was born.\n\nWith Su-vastika, my vision is even larger. The world is moving towardssustainable energy, smart power backup solutions, and advanced energy storage systems. I am now focusing on creating patented technologies that will shape the future of power solutions—solutions that are not just reliable and efficient but also environmentally friendly and future-ready.\n\nToday, Su-vastika is leading the way in Lithium Battery Energy Storage, Solar Energy Innovations, and Automatic Power Backup Systems. We are not just creating products; we are building an ecosystem of knowledge, innovation, and global impact.The AI is the new mantra for products, and we are building AI into each product to make them smart.\n\nOutside of work, I find inspiration and balance in my personal passions—swimming clears my mind, whistling lifts my spirit, trekking fuels my adventurous side,Yoga keeps me fit and reading keeps my mind sharpand ever-curious. These interests aren’t just hobbies; they’re a reflection of the same passion, discipline, and love for exploration that I bring into my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIf my journey has taught me anything, it is thatsuccess is not about what you achieve—it’s about the challenges you overcome, the knowledge you share, and the legacy you leave behind.Through Su-vastika, I want to continue pushing the boundaries of technology, inspiring the next generation of innovators, and proving that with determination, India can lead the world in power solutions.\n\nThe journey is far from over. In fact, it is only just beginning.\n\nThe future of DC systems in India The article discusses how Solar DC Systems could help solve India’s power crisis.\n\nजिद्द यालाच म्हणतात! पेन विकून खर्च भागवला, दुकानात काम करून उभी केली कोट्यवधींची कंपनी Authored Byप्रियांका वर्तक | महाराष्ट्र\n\nSuccess Story: कभी बसों में बेची पेन, शानदार आइडिया से किया कमाल, आज हैं 2300 करोड़ की कंपनी के मालिक\n\nThe story of Su-Kam and its founder, Kunwer Sachdev, is a notable one in the Indian business landscape, detailing both\n\nBeyond the Inverter: Unpacking the Entrepreneurial Journey of Su-Kam’s Founder We often see the finished product, the successful brand that\n\nKunwer Sachdev (born 16 November 1962) is an Indian entrepreneur who is the founder and Managing Director of Su-Kam.

        "content": "Kunwer Sachdev: The Visionary Entrepreneur Powering India's Future\n\nFrom the narrow lanes of Delhi to boardrooms across the globe, Kunwer Sachdev's journey is not just one of business success—it's a story of resilience, vision, and a relentless drive to solve real problems. Known as “The Inverter Man of India” and now fondly called “The Solar Man of India,” Kunwer is a man who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against him—and turned that dream into light for millions.\n\nA Spark Ignited Early\n\nKunwer Sachdev was born in a modest home in Delhi, where power cuts were a part of daily life. He wasn’t born into privilege, nor did he carry a degree from a fancy business school. What he had, however, was far more powerful—curiosity, courage, and clarity of purpose. He could see what others overlooked: the quiet suffering of families left in the dark and businesses crippled by unreliable electricity.\n\nWhile others adapted to the darkness, Kunwer chose to challenge it.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam: Lighting Up Lives\n\nIn 1988, with more grit than capital, Kunwer founded Su-Kam Power Systems. He didn’t just want to build a company—he wanted to solve a national problem. From inventing the world’s first plastic-body inverter to creating the iconic Home UPS, he turned Su-Kam into a beacon of innovation.\n\nUnder his leadership, Su-Kam wasn’t just a business—it was a movement. A movement that brought power, dignity, and stability to homes and villages across India. The company grew from a small setup to a global brand operating in over 90 countries, winning hearts and awards along the way.\n\nBut behind every product was a purpose. And behind every success, a sleepless night of hard work.\n\nA Story Worth Telling\n\nThe world took notice of this self-made man with a mission. Kunwer’s journey has been chronicled in some of India’s most inspiring books:\n\n- Booming Brands by Harsh Pamnani – capturing how he built Su-Kam into a trusted name from scratch.- Making Breakthrough Innovations Happen by Porus Munshi – highlighting his passion for solving India's energy crisis through bold, scalable ideas.- Connect the Dots by Rashmi Bansal – showcasing Kunwer as the everyday hero who built an empire without an MBA, but with the school of life as his teacher.\n\nEach page is a tribute to his belief: Innovation is for everyone. Especially the ones who need it most.\n\nReinventing for Tomorrow: Su-vastika & Kunwwer.ai\n\nEven after building one of India’s most successful power brands, Kunwer didn’t stop. His heart still beats for the future—and for those who need it the most.\n\nWith Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., he’s now tackling the next frontier: energy storage. Through lithium-ion batteries and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), he’s helping India move towards a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAnd now, with Kunwwer.ai, he’s stepping into the world of artificial intelligence—yet again ahead of the curve. His vision: to democratize innovation, using AI to bring smart solutions to energy, education, and business.\n\nMore Than an Entrepreneur\n\nKunwer Sachdev is more than just a successful businessman. He is a mentor, a dreamer, a changemaker. He believes that true success lies not in wealth, but in impact—in the number of lives touched, the villages lit up, the hope restored.\n\nWords to Live By\n\n“If your innovation solves a real problem, success will chase you.

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India’s power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev’s innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev’s reputation was severely affected. Despite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev’s journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev’s legacy alive in the power backup industry.https://kunwersachdev.com/the-story-of-inverter-man-of-india-resilience-and-rebuilding\n\nDisclaimer: It is important to note that while Mr. Kunwer Sachdev founded Su-Kam Power Systems, he is no longer associated with the company as of 2019. Any information regarding his involvement in the company’s operations, strategies, or future plans reflects his tenure prior to that date. Therefore, any discussions or analyses of Su-Kam Power Systems should be considered in the context of his past contributions and not his current association with the company.\n\nपेन बेचते बेचते खड़ा कर दिया 2300 करोड़ रुपये का कारोबार, जानिए कौन हैं कुंवर सचदेव"

        "content": "Solar Man Of India:One of the finest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary businessmen of our time is Kunwer Sachdev, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's premier provider of power solutions. Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.\n\nTrending Photos\n\nSuccess Story:The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.Kunwer Sachdev: Rags To RichesA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.Su-Kam- The Unmatched ProductHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did. And he is not done yet.\n\nA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.

        "snippet": "Mr. Kunwer Sachdev is the Founder of One of the most well-known brand in Power Back-up Industry – Su-Kam Power Systems Limited and the ...",
        "content": "There were 1,829 press releases posted in the last 24 hours and 402,830 in the last 365 days.\n\nMr. Kunwer Sachdev is the Founder of One of the most well-known brand in Power Back-up Industry â Su-Kam Power Systems Limited and the Mentor of Su-vastika Solar. Kunwer is an entrepreneur, marketer, innovator, motivational speaker, thinker, and leader.\n\nKunwer Sachdev has been given many titles, such as âThe Inverter Man of Indiaâ and âThe Solar man of India.âÂ  He founded Su-Kam Power Systems Limited in the year 1998 and was associated with the company in one capacity or another till April 2018.Â  As of today, he is mentoring up-and-coming Power Backup & Storage companySu-vastikaPower Systems Private Limited (Hereinafter âSu-vastikaâ).\n\nIntroducing the man behind the power backup revolution in India.\n\nKunwer Sachdevis an entrepreneur, marketer, innovator, motivational speaker, thinker, and leader. He revolutionized the power backup sector in India with innovative and user-friendly products that made India-made inverters a household name not just in India but also in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asian countries, including Bangladesh and Nepal. Due to his contributions to the inverter/UPS and solar sector, he is also referred to as âThe Inverter Man of Indiaâ and âThe Solar man of India.â\n\nThe story begins in the 90s.\n\nIn the 1990s, when India was grappling with electricity problems, Kunwer Sachdev was quick to analyze the unorganized market in the power backup industry, which was in complete disarray at the time with substandard products and local players dominating the market. He was instrumental in transforming the power backup industry into an organized sector by training his team, hiring professionals to organize the products and systems, and creating a service setup that was spread all across India, the Middle East, Africa, and South East Asia.Â\n\nPhilosophy is still driving his life which is full of possibilities and achievements.\n\nâThe decisions are not right or wrong; itâs the outcome of those decisions which is right or wrong. That is why I always take decisions considering them to be the important parameter to succeed in life. â Kunwer Sachdev.\n\nTrue to his philosophy, Kunwer Sachdev was able to see the possibility in even the most mundane things in life and find out innovative ways of making them useful to mankind. Most of the breakthrough innovations you see in the power backup sector are his brainchild.Â\n\nHe invented the worldâs first plastic-body inverter, which was adjudged as âInnovation of the Decadeâ by India Today.Â\n\nHe introduced world-class technologies such as MOSFET\n\nHe brought Microcontrollers and DSP Sine Wave into inverters.Â\n\nHe gave âHome UPSâ to India, combining UPS's features and an inverter into a single piece of equipment.\n\nHe introduced Worldâs first touch-screen UPS, which is Bluetooth enabled so that users can monitor it from their phones.Â\n\nHe created the first 100KVA inverter in 2005, which nobody used to believe. He made a truck with having 100 KVA inverter, and it used to travel all across India to showcase our Indian technology called âPower on wheelsâ.Â\n\nHe created the service network having service vans moving all across India to give door-to-door service\n\nHe envisioned a âMake in Indiaâ company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. So in 2003 he made his then-company Su-kam Power Systems Limited the first company in India to export power electronic products to foreign markets. This was no small feat. It was the first time that he toured various countries with hospitable and inhospitable environments, and faced many issues since there was no precedence from the industry, plus the civil situation in many African nations was unstable, Still, he persevered to make a mark for his products and his country. He swept the international markets in the Middle East, Africa, Bangladesh, and Nepal, where his products are loved for their quality and reliability â so much so that Chinese and American products were completely ousted from these markets.Â\n\nEven today, Indian inverters and UPS are preferred over Chinese, and for that, huge credit goes to his efforts.Â\n\nTenure with Su-Kam Power Systems Private LimitedÂ Â\n\nUnder the able guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, the company kept expanding quickly and became widely known for its expertise in the solar energy industry. In fact, it also became widely known for filing the largest number of patents in the power backup industry, with, on average, two patents being filed each month â including 76 technology patents in India, the United States, and other countries. This was greatly influenced by Kunwer Sachdevâs innovative mindset and ambitions.Â  During his tenure, the company became the first to launch plastic body inverters, a product that made it on the list of the top ten innovations of the decade in 2010. The company also introduced innovative products, including Indiaâs first touchscreen Solar PCU with an MPPT solar charge controller that could be controlled remotely using a smartphone and wifi. It likewise introduced solar streetlights using built-in lithium-ion batteries.Â\n\nDue to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited went into bankruptcy and Kunwer Sachdev became embroiled in several legal battles and was compelled to leave and disassociate himself from what he considered his own for 32 years of his career.Â  The legal battles of a single entrepreneur who changed the map of the power backup sector in India continue to date.Â\n\nThe turnaround and a new beginning.\n\nThe exit of Kunwer Sachdev from the company he founded and ran from its inception till 2018 left a vacuum for the customers, distributors, suppliers, and others connected with the company. Dealers and distributors, along with the customers, were suffering on one side of the services and materials lying with them unsold, and the customerâs warranty claims were left without any solution.Â  In these circumstances, after much struggle and challenges, his wife, Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help and give services to the hapless customers left in the lurch by insolvency proceedings.Â  With a lot of help and support from friends, distributors, and employees, Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev.Â  Joining Su-vastika as a Mentor.\n\nThe products built by Kunwer Sachdev at Su-vastika outsmart many others due to their easy handling and ruggedness. His products do not need any artificial environment like air conditioning; they can work from sub-zero to 55-degree centigrade.\n\nWith the speed at which Kunwer Sachdev and his team were building new technologies, he knew he had to do something to protect them. Thus, he started filing patents and, by doing so, became the first Indian entrepreneur to file for technology and design patents in the Indian power backup Industry.Â\n\nUnder his able guidance, Su-vastika made a record for being the only company in the power backup industry to file for over 60 patents, with nearly 2 technology patents filed in a month. At Su-vastika he is continuously coming up with newer patent ideas, not just in the inverter industry but in many other fields related to energy, artificial intelligence, communications, and many more.\n\nHis strong business acumen and foresightedness help him to gauge the vast opportunities in the solar sector, where he is completely immersed in. He started working passionately in building world-class solar products and developed some unique solar products that suit the needs of everyone, from a small house in a remote village to big industries.Â\n\nWith a towering personality like Kunwer Sachdev and his able mentorship, Su-vastika is constantly building new technologies and filing patents.\n\nSome of the key products developed by Kunwer Sachdev as a mentor of Su-vastika include being sold under the Su-vastika brand are:Â\n\nEnergy Storage SystemsÂ  :Â  Su-vastika grid-connected energy storage system can support a grid 24Ã7 by providing frequency and voltage support. ESS can be a great resource for renewable energy (RE) and electric vehicle (EV) integration with the electricity distribution grid.\n\nEmergency Rescue Devices:Â  Emergency Rescue Device/ERD is an elevator-installed mechanism that acts during power shortages that limit the liftâs performance. In the event that the main power source fails, this emergency equipment supplies a 3-phase power supply to the elevators.\n\nLiFePO4-based batteries :Â  Su-vastika has designed a lithium-ion battery bank that is one of its kind and will completely go to improvise the battery industry as well as the Electric vehicle industry too. LiFePO4 batteries have a lower energy density and operate at lower voltages than lithium-ion batteries. They have a lower discharge rate and flat curves and are safer than Li-ion batteries.\n\nAutomated Testing Setup: Su-vastika has designed an in-house Automatic Testing Setup (ATS).Â\n\nATS aids in high-quality manufacturing and testing of UPS/Inverters, solar inverters, on-grid and off-grid, and hybrid solar inverters for single-phase and 3-phase technology.Â\n\nTheir Automatic Testing set-up includes Electrical vehicle testing machines for the manufacturing of 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers as well as for repairing these EVs\n\nLithium battery testing machines for testing the BMS (Battery Management Solution) as well as testing the whole lithium bank from 12 V to 600 V DC bankÂ\n\nFunctional PCB Testing machines that are universal in nature. All these machines are developed on online monitoring solutions so that one can see the data online and store the important information for future traceability\n\nSolar Compatible EV Chargers: With the push for electric vehicles all over the world, it is more important than ever to think about the source of power. If the electricity a customer is using to charge their electric vehicle is coming from is coal-powered, it is not essentially solving the problem of climate change. Su-vastika has developed solar-powered EV chargers that make power generation clean and pollution free in the true sense.\n\nâI wish to see every household in India get powered by solar energy. I want every business, big or small, to invest in solar energy and reap the seamless benefits of this natural resource.â Kunwer Sachdev\n\nKunwer Sachdev is once again revolutionizing the power backup sector in India. With so many innovations he is doing with LiFePO4 batteries, he is set to acquire a new title, âThe Lithium Man of India.â\n\nMedia ContactCompany Name:CbheraldContact Person:ManishEmail:Send EmailCity:New YorkCountry:United StatesWebsite:cbherald.com\n\nÂ\n\nPress Release Distributed byABNewswire.comTo view the original version on ABNewswire visit:Kunwer Sachdev, The Inverter Man Of India Is Back\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\n\nEIN Presswire provides this news content \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.

It has been alleged that at the time of installation, the OP gave assurance regarding the superiority of their product and promise of best after sales service support. (2 years warranty of replaced PCU w.e.f. 10-March- 2017 in warranty FSR attached for dated 08-Feb-2018 and 25 years warranty of PV solar modules). It has been alleged that to have a working efficient/ seamless Solar system with the existing electrical connection system, she gave entire involved products order to Su-Kam power system Ltd. cost to her on purchase  of complete set of Su-Kam Solar system is as below: - Cost of PCU (Advanced Solar Inverter) = 36,500 INR Cost of Panels (8 Nos) = 1,04,000 INR Cost of batteries 50,000 INR Cost of Structure = 40,000 INR Cost of Installation = 5,000 INR (Above all, Taxes Extra) Total Rs. 2,35,500 INR + Taxes as shown in Annexure-1. It has been alleged that the solar system purchased was with top end model, this being new technology we had no knowledge about product & it's working. M/s Su-Kam approached us through their authorized channel partner and assured about best product, best technology, best services and mentioned that Government of Haryana and Ministry of Renewable Energy (MNRE), Govt. of India have approved their product. It has been alleged that she is a Senior Citizen 66 year, suffering with the problem of sleep Apnea and uses a machine for breathing many a times in a day, which need uninterrupted electric supply and on the assurance of OP, who advertise on television and whose representative Mr. Ashok Kumar explain it to be best product, we got installed the system. It has been alleged that just after the installation of the said machine, she started facing problems like PCU output voltage fluctuations, high input current charging and after approaching to the OP, they were told that these are initial problems as happen with every new installation and would get settled soon. It has been alleged that within a period of 2-3 months, system started giving technical troubles and faults including cracks in solar panels (4 Nos.) which was accepted by Su-Kam stakeholders on quality & replaced. It has been alleged that PCU started malfunctioning and controlling cards going faulty. The complainant complained to customer service, and untrained staff of the OP  had bugged up the system which has led to damaged batteries (at the verge of blast due to high heat), higher input current draw leading to caught fire in wires, plugs, tops, MCBs & joints of connecting main Grid lines. It has been alleged that all the complaints lodged to their management/ customer care teams and many times all customer services calls were closed without any site visit and was notified falsely as closed and this was informed to Su-Kam regional Service manager many a times over a call. It has been alleged that the faulty designed system has led to higher drawn current and gave her huge financial loss as electrical bill & increased many folds as before installing the Su-Kam Solar system, average bimonthly bill was average 7000 INR, where-in post installation of faulty Su-Kam system has led to bimonthly bill value of more than 40,000 INR as shown in Annexure-3. It has been alleged that the reason of fire in wire & electric circuit & battery heat could not be resolved, which give her worries all the time. It has been alleged that on repeated complain the replaced PCU with revised Warranty date (w.e.f. March 2017 for 2 years) is also sent of poor quality and in tempered state and not functioning properly even as normal inverter supply. It has been alleged that in absence of running of breathing machine sometimes they made alternate arrangement for running of breathing machine and sometimes, she had to sleep without machine in operation-which was always a worry as no power backup (2KVA) was available. It has been alleged that this was happening as system is not well designed and not working as per normal PCU behavior & as per promises made/advertised. It has been alleged that all problems and complaints were reported at all management level of Su-Kam through emails & India Post etc. It has been alleged that we even complained to  the Managing Director (MD) of Su-Kam who deliberately ignored her and has put her in big financial loss, mental harassment & family life at risk. It has been alleged that the system is not working properly for many months and on dead position most of the time and it is found that there is fire in PCU at input of current due to consistent fault, which has burnt the MCB, Sockets, Wires & Battery heating resulting into life risk all the time ONLY due to faulty Solar system installed at my home by Su-Kam. It has been alleged that multiple photos of fire burst & installation quality have been sent to Su-Kam but to no avail. Thereafter, the complainant requested the OP several times and complained to several departments but no solution was made by any of them. On the aforesaid allegations, the complainant has prayed before this Forum that a direction may please be given to the opposite party to take back their complete set of faulty Solar system (PCU Inverter, 8 panels and 4 batteries) 8& repay her old aged fund which will help me in leading calm life at this age of her life, to repay the interest charges on complete Bill value @18% and for each month on pro-rata basis if the year is not complete. Further to pay Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rs. 5 Lakhs only) towards mental harassment, agony, living life under perpetual dangerous situation, depression, financial losses due to multiple repairs of cables / existing electrical system & life threat of family at house and litigation charges has also been prayed for.\n\n2. After registration and admission of the complaint, notice was issued to the opposite party and the opposite party appeared through its representative and filed its written statement wherein it has been contended that  the present complaint of complainant does not fall within the purview ofConsumer Protection Act, 1986because the opposite party have not committed any deficiency in service as per the provisions of the said Act, hence the complaint is liable to be dismissed with heavy costs. It has been contended that the present complaint is also not maintainable and tenable as per theprovision of the Consumer Protection Actand by this present false and frivolous complaint; complainant is trying to extort money from the answering opposite party and to waste the valuable time of this Hon'ble Forum. It has been contended that the answering opposite party is a reputed manufacturer and dealer of Su-Kam brand batteries/inverters/Solar and the batteries/inverters/Solar manufactured by the opposite party is of international quality and passed through stringent quality test before removal from its manufacturing unit to be distributed and sold in the market. It has been further contended that every complaint has to be made on customer care numbers of the opposite party, which had been provided on the product itself as well as being advertised in large scale. Each time a complaint is lodged the system of the answering opposite party generates a complaint number which is the proof of complaint being made to the opposite party. It has been contended that as per record the complainant lodged complaints on 25/01/2017,10/03/2017 and 18/02/2018 and after receiving complaints each and every time service engineer of answering opposite party visited at site of complainant and resolved the problem. It is pertinent to mention that as per customer satisfaction the answering opposite party replaced 4 batteries on 25.01.2017, replaced PCU on 11.03.2017 and also replaced PCB card on 18.02.2018. It has been further contended that the Senior engineer of  R & D department of answering opposite party also visited at premises of complainant and analyzed the problem for a few days, after that they took the systems back to R & D and fixed the observed issue of the Solar Charge Controller working intermittently because of that Solar Power was not getting generated. After fixing they tested the system in R&D and it was working fine, then we sent the system back to the complainant premises, for periodic observation they also installed one GSM based remote monitoring solution to monitor the data of the Solar PCU and see the performance. They captured the data for some time, after some days the data stopped coming so they again visited the complainant site to check if the monitoring system was working or not, but the complainant refused to cooperate to checked the issue with the monitoring systems. They observed that the monitoring system was removed from the system. It has been contended that the Solar PCU was working as per specification of the product but the complainant expectation is different from the installed system specification states and it requires carefully designed to achieve that. R&D team of answering opposite party offered to help complainant to design as per her requirement (Solar Panel Capacity required. Solar PCU rating, Battery capacity etc.) but the complainant has refused and filed this false and frivolous complaint. It is also pertinent to mention that the system installed in premises of complainant working properly as per its specification and is still working properly as per Field Service Report dated 18.02.2018. All other facts have been denied as false and frivolous. However, later on, he opted to remain exparte.\n\n3. We have heard the authorised representative of the complainant and perused the record available on file.\n\n4. Therefore, from the facts and circumstances of the case, evidence on the file and the arguments advanced by the authorised representative of the complainant, it emerges that the complainant has filed the present complaint against the OP alleging deficiency in service on the part of the OP on the ground that the complainant has purchased a 2KVA solar system from OP after spending a sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs. As per pleadings of the complainant, since after installation of the solar system, she started facing problems like PCU output voltage fluctuations, high input current charging and after approaching to the OP, they were told that these are initial problems as happen with every new installation and would get settled soon. But as per the complainant, after 2-3 months, system started again giving technical troubles and faults including cracks in solar panels which was accepted by Su-Kam stakeholders on quality & replaced. From the evidence, it is on the file that a 2KVA solar system purchased by the complainant got defective and it repaired every time as and when the complainant approached to the opposite party.\n\nEdit Citation\n\nGet 1 point on providing a valid sentiment to this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCitation.\n\nGet 2 points on providing a valid reason for the above\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchange.\n\nAdd Equivalent Citation\n\nGet 1 point on adding a valid citation to this judgment.\n\nCiteTEXT\n\nSelect Preference\n\nShare the Judgment\n\nHow is this helpful for me?\n\nAre you sure?\n\nBy clicking on this tab, you are expressly stating that you were one of the advocates appearing in this matter.Before confirming, please ensure that you have thoroughly read and verified the judgment.

        "content": "Solar Man Of India:One of the finest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary businessmen of our time is Kunwer Sachdev, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's premier provider of power solutions. Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.\n\nTrending Photos\n\nSuccess Story:The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.Kunwer Sachdev: Rags To RichesA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.Su-Kam- The Unmatched ProductHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members.

During the pendency of the suit, a Liquidator had been\nappointed who has adopted the pleadings, averments and arguments\nadvanced by the resolution professional.\n\nARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF\n\n3.    Mr. Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff stated\nthat the present suit was liable to be decreed summarily as the\ndefendant no. 1 had no real prospect of defending its claim and the\ndefendant no. 1‟s defence was an abuse of the process of law.\n\n4.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the\ndefendant No.1 had made numerous admissions that the plaintiff was\nthe rightful owner, proprietor and user of the Su-Kam Marks in respect\nof goods covered under Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999and\nsuch admissions supersede any and all issues, including those disputed\nby the defendants. He pointed out the following instances wherein the\ndefendant No.1 had represented the plaintiff to be the owner of the Su-\nKam Marks:-\n\n5.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff stated that the defendant\nno.1, by his representations/acts/admissions, had intentionally caused\nothers, including the plaintiff, to believe that the plaintiff was the\nrightful owner of the „Su-Kam‟ marks in Class 9 of theTrade Marks\nAct, 1999and was now estopped from denying the said truth or\npleading to the contrary.In support of his submission, he relied on the\nSupreme Court judgment inJai Narain Parasrampuria (Dead) and\nOthers Vs. Pushpa Devi Saraf and Others, (2006) 7 SCC 756\nwherein it has been held as under:-\n\nbut it is another thing to say that a person is estopped from\n     raising a question of title. The provisions of theEvidence\n     Actare clear likeSection 116, whereby in a certain\n     situation a person may be estopped from pleading a title in\n     himself.\n\nxxxx          xxxx          xxxx        xxxx\n\n36. In the instant case, it was Sarafs who represented the\n     Company. They had made the representation that the\n     Company was the owner of the property. Such a\n     representation had been made to the appellant herein not\n     only in terms of the decree obtained in the said OS No. 267\n     of 1980, but by reason of execution of the other documents\n     including creation of mortgage of the property and\n     discharge thereof in favour of State Bank of India. If by\n     reason of such representation, a third party alters hisCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 4 of 77position, indisputably, the principle of estoppel would apply.\n     We may, however, hasten to add that where there exists a\n     statutory embargo, vesting of title in a person shall be\n     subject thereto. We have, however, in this case, no doubt\n     whatsoever that there did not exist any statutory embargo in\n     this behalf.‖\n\n6.     Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff emphasized that\ndefendant no.1 had not come to this Court with clean hands, had made\ngross misrepresentations and had taken contradictory stands on\nvarious occasions. He pointed out the following instances which\naccording to him disentitled the defendant no.1 from seeking a trial in\nthe suit:-\n\n7.    Per contra, Mr. Rajeev Virmani, learned senior counsel for\ndefendant no. 1 contended that oral evidence was required to be led in\nthe present suit as the plaint alleged that the Deed of Assignment dated\n16th March, 2006 as well as the Trade Mark Licence Agreement dated\n7th July, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'TMLA') were questionable\nand sought declarations that the Deed of Assignment was fabricated\nand the TMLA had stood terminated respectively.\n\n8.    He also pointed out that though the plaint averred that the\nBusiness Transfer Agreement dated 16th September, 1999 (for short\n\"BT Agreement\") and the Minutes of the Meeting dated 20th March,\n2006 (for short \"Minutes\") were fabricated, yet no relief had been\nclaimed qua the said BT Agreement and Minutes.\n\n9.     He emphasised that while the plaintiff had filed an expert\nforensic report in support of some of its allegations, the defendant no.1\nhad also filed contrary forensic reports to deny any allegation of\nfabrication. He contended that the defendant no.1 had denied all\nallegations   of     documents   being    fabricated   or   questionable.\nConsequently, according to Mr. Virmani, the issue that would arise in\nthe matter is whether the impugned documents were fabricated or\nquestionable or authentic. He submitted that where contentious issues\nof fraud and fabrication arise, a suit cannot be decided summarily and\nwithout oral evidence.In support of his submission, he relied upon a\njudgment of the Supreme Court inState Bank of Saurashtra vs.\nAshit Shipping Services (P) Ltd. & Anr., (2002) 4 SCC 736, wherein\nit has been held as under:-\n\n10.    He stated that the plaintiff had no reasonable prospect of\nsucceeding in its claim as the defendant no. 1 had started using theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 7 of 77SU-KAM Mark as its proprietor in 1986. He stated that the defendant\nno.1 had coined and adopted the trademark Su-Kam in the year 1986\nand was the proprietor of the trade mark Su-Kam in all classes, except\nfor Class 9, under theTrade Marks Act, 1999.\n\n11.   He pointed out that the defendant no. 1, in partnership with his\nfather, had started the firm Su-Kam Communication Systems on 23rd\nApril, 1981 and licenced the trade mark SU-KAM to the partnership\nfirm vide the aforesaid TMLA. He contended that the TMLA was a\nvalid agreement.\n\n12.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no.1 stated that the\nplaintiff Company was incorporated on 14th October, 1998. He stated\nthat the BT Agreement was entered between the partnership firm (i.e.\nM/s. Su-Kam Communication Systems) and SU-KAM Power Systems\nLtd.(the plaintiff herein), whereby not only did the plaintiff become\nthe successor in interest of the said partnership firm but also the\ntrademark licence was transferred to the plaintiff. He stated that the\nBT Agreement which was filed with the Registrar of Companies along\nwith return of allotment in 2002, clearly recorded defendant no.1 to be\nthe owner of the Su-Kam marks, ―4. The trade mark / Brand Name\n―SU-KAM‖ shall remain the property of Mr. Kunwer Deep Sachdeva,\nProp M/s SU-KAM CABLE TV SYSTEMS, New Delhi. The trade mark/\nAmount of Royalty for using the brand name SU-KAM shall be\nmutually decided between the company and Kunwer Deep Sachdeva\nfrom Year to Year basis.‖ He emphasised that under the BT\nAgreement, the plaintiff had acknowledged that the partnership firm\nwas engaged in the Inverter business. Thus, according to him, theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                       Page 8 of 77plaintiff being the licencee, could not have proprietary rights in the\nSU-KAM trade mark.\n\n13.   He reiterated that though defendant no. 1 had applied for SU-\nKAM in class 9 vide the Trade Mark Application No. 821727 on 5th\nOctober, 2008 (i.e. prior to incorporation of plaintiff-company), yet\nthe trade mark records showed that the said mark had been registered\nin the name of the plaintiff, ignoring the claim of defendant no. 1. He\nstated that upon discovery of said mistake, the said Deed of\nAssignment had been executed by the plaintiff in favour of the\ndefendant no. 1. He contended that the plaintiff had not provided any\nparticulars as to how the said Deed of Assignment was fabricated.\n\n14.   He further submitted that an assignment takes effect from the\ndate of assignment and an assignee acquires title in a trademark\nimmediately upon execution of the assignment deed. He pointed out\nthat any follow up actions required to be taken under theTrade Marks\nAct, 1999, following the execution of an assignment deed would not\nchange the title already acquired.In support of his submission, he\nrelied onSun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited vs. Cipla Limited,\n2009 (108) DRJ 207, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n15.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no.1 submitted that\nprior to the amendment of theTrade Marks Act, 1999in 2010, in\nterms of Section 45(2) of the erstwhileTrade Marks Act, 1999, an\nassignment deed could not have been read in evidence in any Court or\ntribunal without express directions of the Court or Tribunal. He stated,\nhowever, that this provision stood deleted byThe Trade Marks\nAmendment Act, 2010. He submitted that the effect of such deletion is\nthat a non-recordal of assignment by the assignee makes the\nassignment ineffective only against third parties and not against the\nassignor itself, who is aware of the existence/execution of the\ndocument.\n\n16.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no.1 contended that\nthere had been no abandonment of the trademark Su-Kam by the\ndefendant no.1. He contended that in terms of Clause 5 of the TMLA,\nall use of the trade mark would enure to the benefit of the Licensor,\ni.e. defendant no.1.\n\n17.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 stated that the\nrepresentations to Reliance India Power Fund were dated 27th\nFebruary 2006, i.e. prior to execution of Deed of Assignment. In any\nevent, he stated that at that stage defendant no. 1 and his family ownedCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 10 of 77the entire shareholding of the plaintiff company and the defendant\nno. 1 treated the company as its alter-ego and did not consider the\ncompany to be separate from defendant no.1.\n\n18.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 stated that the\ndefendant no. 1 did not sign the plaint of the infringement suit filed in\n2015 by the plaintiff. He pointed out that the plaintiff did not authorise\nthe person signing the plaint and was unaware of the said suit. He\nstated that, in any event, in terms of the TMLA, the plaintiff was\nobligated to maintain the licensed trademark, i.e. SU-KAM, including\ntaking all actions to protect the said trademark. He emphasised that\nthe plaintiff had instituted the suit in 2015 in discharge of its\nobligations under the TMLA.\n\n19.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 stated that, the\nErnst and Young Report was based on assertions made by the plaintiff\nand as stated in the report no independent trade mark search had been\nconducted. He pointed out that the plaintiff had also filed another\nvaluation report of the trademark Su-Kam by VGrow Advisors Pvt.\nLtd. which specified that the trademark being valued belonged to the\ndefendant no. 1.\n\n20.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 contended that\nthe question of estoppel in the present suit did not arise as the plaintiff\nhad acknowledged the defendant no.1 to be the proprietor of the\ntrademark Su-Kam in the BT Agreement. He contended that the\nplaintiff was all along aware of the true facts regarding the defendant\nno.1‟s ownership of the Su-Kam marks and there could be no estoppel\nwhere truth is known to both parties. In support of his contention, heCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                           Page 11 of 77relied on Mohori Bibee and Another vs. Dharmodas Ghose, 7 CWN\n441, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n21.   Mr.Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff handed\nover an affidavit dated 02nd May, 2019, whereby the plaintiff gave up\nparts of prayer (a) and (b), which were premised on allegations of\nfraud and fabrication and prayer (g)       pertaining to damages. The\nrelevant portion of the affidavit dated 02nd May, 2019, is reproduced\nhereinbelow-\n\n―15. I hereby state that in view of the foregoing, the\n         Plaintiff is hereby giving up its claims based on fraud\n         and fabrication and consequent relief(s) based thereon,\n         for the purposes of the Application for Summary\n         Judgment underOrder XIIIA of CPC, and is agreeableCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 12 of 77to lesser prayers being granted on the basis of the\n         categorical admissions and holding out by the\n         Defendant No.1, inter alia, as to ownership of the SU-\n         KAM Marks vesting in the Plaintiff. Therefore, the\n         Plaintiff hereby states that it hereby gives up the\n         following prayers, which are premised on the\n         allegations of fraud and fabrication, as stated\n         hereinafter:\n\n16. I am advised that even otherwise the reliance by the\n        Defendant No.1 on the Deed of Assignment dated March\n        16, 2006 in his defence ought to be rejected in view of the\n        fact that the said Deed is invalid and that the Defendant\n        No.1 cannot rely upon the same on the grounds that the\n        Deed of Assignment has been executed by him in breach\n        of his fiduciary duty under law; the holding out by himCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 13 of 77that the Plaintiff is the sole owner and registered\n        proprietor of the SU-KAM Marks and the consequent\n        estoppel under law; and his failure to act upon the Deed\n        of Assignment for a period of 12 years from the execution\n        thereof. I am advised that the said defence can be\n        rejected by this Hon'ble Court on the said basis without it\n        having to pass an order of declaration. Further, I say that\n        insofar as the Trade Mark License Agreement dated July\n        7, 1995 is concerned, the Plaintiff is seeking a limited\n        relief that the same is not and never was applicable to it.\n        I am advised that such an Order is not based on\n        allegations of fraud and fabrication and can be granted\n        by this Hon'ble Court without trial. I also state that the\n        Plaintiff is entitled to other reliefs as prayed for in\n        prayers (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) and (i).‖\n\n22.   The amended prayer clause handed over by learned senior\ncounsel for plaintiff on 03rd May, 2019 is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n23.   Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff contended that if the\nplaintiff is able to show that the defendant has no real prospect of\nsuccessfully defending the claim, then unless the defendant shows that\nthere is a compelling reason to lead oral evidence, summary judgment\nmust be granted in favour of the plaintiff. He submitted that the onus\non the defendant for summary judgment is lower than the judgment onCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                       Page 15 of 77admission. He further submitted that judgment on admission is\ndiscretionary, whereas summary judgment must be granted where the\nCourt finds that either plaintiff or defendant has no real prospect of\nsucceeding or there is no compelling reason to lead oral evidence. He\nstated that discretion in grant of summary judgment lies in moulding\nthe relief only.\n\n24.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that\nthe test for summary judgment is not whether the defence is a sham or\nmoonshine-which is the test for leave to defend in a summary suit. He\nsubmitted that the standard in a summary judgment should be lower\nthan that of a summary suit because there the Court has to decide\nwhether to allow a defence at all; whereas, in a summary judgment the\ndefence is on record as both the parties are duty bound to state on oath\nthat they have disclosed all documentary evidence in their possession.\n\n25.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff stated that Rule 24 of the\nCivil Procedure Rules in England is pari materia to Order XIII-A.\nLearned senior counsel for plaintiff relied upon the test for summary\njudgment laid down by Courts in England and Wales inEasyair\nLimited v. Opal Telecom Limited[2009] EWHC 339 (Ch.)which was\nreiterated in Ruanne Dellal v. Guy Dellal, [2015] EWHC 907 (Fam)\nand is reproduced hereinbelow-\n\n―i) The court must consider whether the claimant has a\n      \"realistic\" as opposed to a \"fanciful\" prospect of\n      success: Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91;\n\nii) A \"realistic\" claim is one that carries some degree of\n      conviction. This means a claim that is more than merely\n      arguable: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel [2003]\n      EWCA Civ 472 at [8];\n\niii) In reaching its conclusion the court must not conduct a\n     \"mini-trial\": Swain v Hillman;\n\niv) This does not mean that the court must take at face value\n     and without analysis everything that a claimant says in his\n     statements before the court. In some cases it may be clear\n     that there is no real substance in factual assertions made,\n     particularly    if   contradicted    by    contemporaneous\n     documents: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel at [10];\n\nv) However, in reaching its conclusion the court must take\n     into account not only the evidence actually placed before it\n     on the application for summary judgment, but also the\n     evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at\n     trial: Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond (No\n\n5) [2001] EWCA Civ 550;\n\nvi) Although a case may turn out at trial not to be really\n     complicated, it does not follow that it should be decided\n     without the fuller investigation into the facts at trial than is\n     possible or permissible on summary judgment. Thus the court\n     should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial,\n     even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of\n     the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing\n     that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add\n     to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so\n     affect the outcome of the case: Doncaster Pharmaceuticals\n     Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd [2007] FSR\n     63;\n\nvii) On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application\n     under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or\n     construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it\n     all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the\n     question and that the parties have had an adequate\n     opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the\n     nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the\n     respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real\n     prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending\n     the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 17 of 77applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined,\n      the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although\n      material in the form of documents or oral evidence that\n      would put the documents in another light is not currently\n      before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be\n      expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give\n      summary judgment because there would be a real, as\n      opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not\n      enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go\n      to trial because something may turn up which would have a\n      bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemicals &\n      Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 725.\"\n\n26.     Learned senior counsel for plaintiff submitted that summary\njudgment could be refused if there was a compelling reason to conduct\na trial. The learned senior counsel referred to Blackstone's Civil\nPractice: The Commentary and stated that compelling reasons for\ngoing to trial include -\n\n―(a) The respondent is unable to contact a material\n        witness who may provide material for a defence.\n\n(b) The case is highly complicated such that judgment\n        should only be given after mature consideration at trial.\n\n(c) The facts are wholly within the applicant's hands. In\n        such a case it may be unjust to enter judgment without\n        giving the respondent an opportunity of establishing a\n        defence in the light of disclosure or after serving a request\n        for further information. However, summary judgment will\n        not necessarily be refused in cases where the evidence for\n        any possible defence could only lie with the applicant if\n        there is nothing devious or artificial in the claim.\n\n(d) The applicant has acted harshly or unconscionably,\n        or the facts disclose a suspicion of dishonesty or\n        deviousness on the part of the applicant such thatCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 18 of 77judgment should only be obtained in the light of publicity\n        at trial.‖\n\n27.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff stated that the only reason\nfor going to trial, in the present case, as set out by the defendant no.1\nwas that the plaintiff had made allegations of fraud and fabrication and\ncertain prayers were sought based on these allegations. He pointed out\nthat this reason no longer survived inasmuch as the plaintiff had given\nup those prayers by filing an affidavit dated 02nd May, 2019.\n\n28.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff contended that defendant\nno.1 had made no averment in his pleadings with respect to actual use\nof the marks for inverters and in absence of such pleading, he could\nnot lead evidence for the same. He emphasised that reliance on trade\nmark registrations which were not in respect of inverters were in any\ncase liable for cancellation on account of non-use.In support of his\nsubmission, he relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court inAmerican Home Products Corporation Vs. Mac Laboratories Pvt.\nLtd. & Anr., (1986) 1 SCC 465, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n29.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff emphasised that the\nplaintiff‟s use of the SU-KAM mark for the inverter business was not\npursuant to any licence from the defendant no.1, but in its own right as\na proprietor of the mark. He pointed out that at the time of execution\nof the alleged TMLA, the licence was not for use of the SU-KAM\ntrademark for the inverter business but in respect of Cable TVs and\nrelated goods and services.\n\n30.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff contended, in any event,\nthat when the BT Agreement was executed, the mark Su-Kam was\nunregistered and only ownership of the goodwill in the existing\nbusiness of defendant no.1 or goods which used the Su-Kam mark,\nunder licence from defendant no.1, could have been transferred under\nthe BT Agreement. He emphasised that the only business which the\nerstwhile partnership was engaged in, at that time, was the business of\nCable TV and that the defendant no.1 did not own any goodwill in the\ntrade mark Su-Kam in relation to the inverter business. He therefore\ncontended that the statement in the BT Agreement could, at the most,\nrefer to ownership of the trade mark Su-Kam in relation to the Cable\nTV business.\n\n31.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff stated that the terms of BT\nAgreement stipulated that the Su-Kam would remain the property of\ndefendant no.1 and royalty in respect of the same would be decided\nbetween the plaintiff and defendant no.1. He stated that admittedly no\nroyalty for the use of the brand Su-Kam had ever been paid by the\nplaintiff.\n\n32.      Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff further stated that the\nDeed of Assignment dated 16th March, 2006, was invalid as it had\nbeen executed by the defendant no.1 on behalf of both, the assignor\nand the assignee and such act of the defendant no.1 was contrary to the\nduties placed on the Director of a company underSection 166of the\nCompanies Act, 2013. He reiterated that the Deed of Assignment had\nnever been acted upon by the defendant no.1 and a request for recordal\nof assignment was filed belatedly by the defendant no.1 on 18 th July,\n2018, only i.e. after a gap of twelve years, which showed his mala\nfides.\n\n33.      Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the\nexecution of Deed of Assignment was not authorised by the Board of\nDirectors on account of lack of proper quorum for the Board Meeting.\nHe stated that three members were present for the Board meeting on\n20th March, 2006, i.e. defendant no.1, Mrs. Geeta Sachdeva (wife of\ndefendant no.1) and Mr. Nagender Bajaj.          He contended that as\ndefendant no.1 and Mrs. Geeta Sachdeva were interested Directors,\nthey could not ―take part in the discussions of or vote on‖ in\naccordance with the mandate ofSection 300of the Companies Act,\n1956.      He submitted that due to defendant no.1 and his wife‟s\nparticipation in the Board Meeting on 20th March, 2006 any resolution\npassed in the said meeting cannot be relied or acted upon.\n\nSUR-REJOINDER AND REPLY\n\n34.      At the fag end of the rejoinder arguments, learned counsel for\ndefendant no.1 filed an application underOrder VI Rule 17 CPCforCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                           Page 24 of 77amendment of the written statement incorporating the plea that the\npresent suit was barred by limitation. Learned counsel for defendant\nno.1 submitted that the present application for amendment was\nnecessitated in view of the amendment of the prayer clause by the\nplaintiff. The said amendment application was allowed vide order\ndated 23rd August, 2019 without prejudice to the rights and\ncontentions of either of the parties.\n\n35.   In sur-rejoinder, learned senior counsel for defendant no.1\nsubmitted that the prayer regarding invalidity of the Deed of\nAssignment dated 16th March, 2006 was barred by limitation as the\nsame could not be raised thirteen years after its execution because\nEntry 58 of theSchedule to the Limitation Act, 1963stipulated that\nthe limitation for obtaining a declaration stating that the document is\ninvalid is limited to ―three years from when the right to sue accrued‖.\n\n36.   According to learned senior counsel for defendant no.1, in the\npresent case the right to sue would accrue from the date the Deed of\nAssignment was entered i.e. 16th March, 2006. Hence, he submitted\nthat the relief claimed by the plaintiff with regard to the declaration of\ninvalidity of the Deed of Assignment was barred by limitation.\n\n37.   He lastly submitted that plaintiff‟s arguments with regard to\nlack of quorum and interested directors were irrelevant and should not\nbe examined by this Court as it was not mandatory for the Board of\nDirectors to approve/sanction the Deed of Assignment.\n\n38.   In reply, Mr. Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff\nsubmitted that the right to sue accrued in favour of plaintiff only in\n2018 when defendant no.1 denied plaintiff‟s title to the SU-KAMCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 25 of 77marks in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999and claimed ownership\nbefore the Interim Resolution Professional. This according to him\nresulted in the general public being deterred from submitting\nresolution plans for plaintiff and consequently, only one resolution\nplan had been received and that too from defendant no.1. Plaintiff\nalso placed reliance onSections 31and34of the Specific Relief Act,\n1963.\n\nCOURT'S REASONING\nUNDER RULE 3 OF ORDER XIII-ACPCTHERE WILL BE ‗NO\nREAL PROSPECT OF SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING THE\nCLAIM' WHEN THE COURT IS ABLE TO MAKE THE\nNECESSARY FINDING OF FACT, APPLY THE LAW TO THE\nFACTS, AND THE SAME IS A PROPORTIONATE, MORE\nEXPEDITIOUS AND LESS EXPENSIVE MEANS TO ACHIEVE\nA FAIR AND JUST RESULT.\n\n39.The Commercial Courts Act, 2015has been enacted with the\nintent to improve efficiency and reduce delay in disposal of\ncommercial cases. The relevant portion of the Statement of Objects\nand Reasons of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n40.   AmendedOrder XIIIA of CPC, as applicable to commercial\ndisputes, enables the Court to decide a claim or part thereof without\nrecording oral evidence.Order XIIIA of CPCseeks to avoid the long\ndrawn process of leading oral evidence in certain eventualities.\nConsequently, the said provision enables disposal of commercial\ndisputes in a time bound manner and promotes the object of theCommercial Courts Act, 2015.\n\n41.   Rule 3 of Order XIII-Aof CPCempowers the Court to grant a\nsummary judgment against a defendant where on an application filed\nin that regard, the Court considers that the defendant has no real\nprospect of successfully defending a claim, and there is no other\ncompelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before\nrecording of oral evidence. Order XIIIA (3)of CPC, as applicable to\ncommercial disputes, is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n42.   Consequently, the new Rule, applicable to commercial disputes,\ndemonstrates that trial is no longer the default procedure/norm.\n\n43.   Rule 24.2 of Civil Procedure Rules in England is identical to\nRule 3 ofOrder XIIIA of CPC. It refers to the words ‗no realCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 27 of 77prospect' of being successful or succeeding. Rule 24.2 of Civil\nProcedure Rules in England is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n44.   While deciding the test for summary judgment under Rule 24.2,\nHouse of Lords in Three Rivers District Council and Others vs.\nGovernor and Company of the Bank of England [2003] 2 A.C. 1,\nreiterated the observation in Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 that\nthe word ‗real' distinguishes ‗fanciful' prospects of success and it\ndirects the Court to examine whether there is a ‗realistic' as opposed\nto a ‗fanciful' prospect of success. The House of Lords in Three\nRivers District Council (supra) also held that the Court while\nconsidering the words ‗no real prospect' should look to see what will\nhappen at the trial and that if the case is so weak that it has no\nreasonable prospect of success, it should be stopped before great\nexpenses are incurred. The relevant portion of the Three Rivers\nDistrict Council (supra) judgment is reproduced hereinebelow:-\n\n[92] The overriding objective of the CPR is to enable the\n    court to deal with cases justly: rule 1.1. To adopt the\n    language ofarticle 6(1)of the European Convention for the\n    Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n    with which this aim is consistent, the court must ensure that\n    there is a fair trial. It must seek to give effect to the\n    overriding objective when it exercises any power given to it\n    by the Rules or interprets any rule: rule 1.2. While the\n    difference between the two tests is elusive, in many cases the\n    practical effect will be the same. In more difficult and\n    complex cases such as this one, attention to the overriding\n    objective of dealing with the case justly is likely to be more\n    important than a search for the precise meaning of the rule.\n    As May LJ said in Purdy v Cambran (unreported) 17\n    December 1999: Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript\n    No 2290 of 1999:\n\n45.   The Supreme Court of Canada in Robert Hryniak v. Fred\nMauldin and Ors, 2014 SCC OnLine Can SC 53 has also held that\ntrial should not be the default procedure. In the said case, which was\nan action for civil fraud against the appellant and a corporate lawyer,\nwho acted for the appellant, the allegation was that the appellant,\nthrough that company, had transferred more than US $10 million to an\noffshore bank following which he claimed that the money had been\nstolen. That money had initially been transferred to the appellant‟s\ncompany, by the respondents therein, in respect of an investment\nopportunity.\n\n46.   The Trial Court as well as the Court of Appeal considered Rule\n20 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure (RCP) and the appropriate\nstandard of review in granting a summary judgment. Rule 20 of RCP\nreads as: ―....(1) The court shall grant a summary judgment if, (a) theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 31 of 77court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with\nrespect to a claim or defence; or (b) the parties agree to have all or\npart of the claim determined by a summary judgment and the court is\nsatisfied that it is appropriate to grant summary judgment. (2.1) In\ndetermining under clause (2)(a) whether there is a genuine issue\nrequiring a trial, the court shall consider the evidence submitted by\nthe parties.....‖. It is pertinent to mention that the amendments to the\nRCP in December 2008 changed the test from ―a genuine issue for\ntrial‖ to whether ―there is a genuine issue requiring trial‖. The case\nwas thereafter referred to the Supreme Court of Canada by way of an\nappeal from the Court of Appeal.\n\n47.   The Supreme Court of Canada, despite allegation of fraud, did\nnot exercise the power to record oral evidence. Instead, the Court\ngranted summary judgment in favour of the respondents/plaintiff on\nthe basis of the material/pleadings already available with it. The Court\nheld that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial when the judge is\nable to reach a fair and just determination on the merits on a motion\nfor summary judgment. The Court further held that that is the case\nwhen the process allows the judge to make necessary findings of fact,\nallows the judge to apply the law to such facts and when such a\nprocess is proportionate, more expeditious and a less expensive means\nof achieving a just result. Consequently, when a summary judgment\nmotion allows the judge to find the necessary facts and resolve the\ndispute, it would not be necessary to proceed to trial. In this regard\nthe standard for fairness is whether or not the procedure involved in a\nsummary judgment would give the judge the confidence to findCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 32 of 77necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles to resolve the\ndispute. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n(2.1) [Powers] In determining under clause (2)(a) whether\n      there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, the court shall\n      consider the evidence submitted by the parties and, if the\n      determination is being made by a judge, the judge may\n      exercise any of the following powers for the purpose, unless\n      it is in the interest of justice for such powers to be exercised\n      only at a trial:\n\n(2.2) [Oral Evidence (Mini-Trial)] A judge may, for the\n      purposes of exercising any of the powers set out in sub-rule\n      (2.1), order that oral evidence be presented by one or more\n      parties, with or without time limits on its presentation.\n\n[43] The Ontario amendments changed the test for summary\n      judgment from asking whether the case presents ―a genuine\n      issue for trial‖ to asking whether there is a ―genuine\n      issue requiring a trial‖. The new rule, with its enhanced\n      fact-finding powers, demonstrates that a trial is not the\n      default procedure. Further, it eliminated the presumption of\n      substantial indemnity costs against a party that brought an\n      unsuccessful motion for summary judgment, in order to\n      avoid deterring the use of the procedure.\n\nxxx                xxx                xxx\n      [49] There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when\n      the judge is able to reach a fair and just determination on\n      the merits on a motion for summary judgment. This will be\n      the case when the process (1) allows the judge to make the\n      necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the\n      law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more\n      expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just\n      result.\n\n[50] These principles are interconnected and all speak to\n      whether summary judgment will provide a fair and just\n      adjudication. When a summary judgment motion allows the\n      judge to find the necessary facts and resolve the dispute,\n      proceeding to trial would generally not be proportionate,\n      timely or cost effective. Similarly, a process that does not\n      give a judge confidence in her conclusions can never be the\n      proportionate way to resolve a dispute. It bears reiterating\n      that the standard for fairness is not whether the procedure\n      is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether it gives the judgeCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                       Page 36 of 77confidence that she can find the necessary facts and apply\n      the relevant legal principles so as to resolve the dispute.‖\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n48.   In fact, the Federal Court Ottawa, Ontario in Louis Vuitton\nMalletier S.A. v. Singga Enterprises (Canada) Inc., 2011 FC 776 and\nHigh Court of Ireland in Abbey International Finance Ltd. v. Point\nIreland Helicopters Ltd. Anr, [2012] IEHC 374, have held that even\ndamages as well as unliquidated compensation can be awarded by way\nof summary judgment. The relevant portion of the said judgments are\nreproduced hereinbelow:-\n\nadmittedly low-standard of proof which has to be achieved in\n      order to avoid summary judgment. In the absence of an\n      ability to seek summary judgment in a non-liquidated claim\n      an unmeritorious defendant can procrastinate for months or\n      perhaps years. That would be an obvious injustice to a\n      plaintiff in such a case.\n\n19. I believe there to be an inherent jurisdiction in the\n      court to enable a plaintiff to seek summary judgment in such\n      circumstances. It is true that there is no specific provision in\n      the Rules of the superior Courts to enable such anCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 38 of 77application to be brought, save in respect of cases in the\n      Commercial List to which I will turn in due course. But the\n      absence of a specific rule should not deny a meritorious\n      plaintiff from speedy relief against an unmeritorious\n      defendant in an appropriate case.‖\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n49.   Consequently, this Court is of the view that when a summary\njudgment application allows the Court to find the necessary facts and\nresolve the dispute, proceeding to trial would generally not be\nproportionate, timely or cost effective. It bears reiteration that the\nstandard for fairness is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a\ntrial, but whether it gives the Court the confidence that it can find the\nnecessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to resolve\nthe dispute as held in Robert Hryniak (supra).\n\n50.   In fact, the legislative intent behind introducing summary\njudgment underOrder XIIIA of CPCis to provide a remedy\nindependent, separate and distinct from judgment on admissions and\nsummary judgment underOrder XXXVII of CPC.\n\n51.   This Court clarifies that in its earlier judgment inVenezia\nMobili (India) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Ramprastha Promoters & Developers\nPvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7761 while deciding two\napplications, both filed by the plaintiff in the said case (one under\nOrder XII Rule 6 and other under Order XIIIA) it had applied the\nlowest common denominator test under both the provisionsof the\nCode of Civil Procedureand held that the suit could be decreed by\nway of a summary judgment.\n\n52.   Consequently, this Court is of the opinion that there will be ‗no\nreal prospect of successfully defending the claim' when the Court is\nable to reach a fair and just determination on the merits of the\napplication for summary judgment. This will be the case when the\nprocess allows the court to make the necessary finding of fact,\napply the law to the facts, and the same is a proportionate, more\nexpeditious and less expensive means to achieve a fair and just\nresult.\n\nAS THE PLAINTIFF HAS GIVEN UP ITS PRAYERS BASED ON\nFRAUD, THE SUBMISSION THAT SUCH RELIEFS CANNOT BE\nGRANTED WITHOUT A TRIAL IS OTIOSE.\n\n53.   In view of the plaintiff having given up its claims and prayers\nbased on fraud and fabrication by filing an affidavit dated 02 nd May,\n2019, the submission of defendant no.1 that such reliefs cannot be\ngranted without a trial does not survive.\n\nSINCE THE PLAINTIFF IS THE EXCLUSIVE REGISTERED\nPROPRIETOR OF THE MARKS SU-KAM IN CLASS 9, THE\nDEFENDANT NO. 1'S SUBMISSIONS WITH REGARD TO EARLIER\nTMLA OR BT AGREEMENT AND/OR SUBSEQUENT DEED OF\nASSIGNMENT ARE BASELESS AND INCONSEQUENTIAL.\n\n54.   In the present case, plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the\nmark SU-KAM with respect to inverters which falls within the scope\nof Class 9-in which class admittedly defendant no.1 has no\nregistration. Registration certificates for the marks SU-KAM in favour\nof the plaintiff in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999along with\nstatus pages from Trade Marks Registry‟s E-Register are reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\nAs annexed\n\n\n\n\nSealed at my direction this          05th           day of February, 2011\n                                                      Sd/-\n\nCertificate Detail   Certificate No. 925845 Dated : 05/02/2011\nValid upto/          09/03/2026\nRenewed upto\nProprietor name     (1) SU-KAM POWER SYSTEMS LTD;\n\nBody Incorporate\nProprietor Address WZ-1401/2, NANGAL RAYA NEW DELHI-110046.\n\nFOR BATTERIES OF DIFFERENT TYPES AND SIZES,\n                    BATTERY WATER, SOLAR INVERTERS, CHARGE\n                    CONTROLLERS AND POWER CONDITIONING UNITS (PCU)\n                    AND OTHER SOLAR ENERGY RELATED PRODUCTS\"\n\n55.      From the aforesaid Certificates it is apparent that the plaintiff is\nthe exclusive registered proprietor of the SU-KAM marks for the\ninverter business in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999and the\nsame had been renewed on 05th October, 2008 and 09th March, 2016\nwhen the defendant no. 1 was in exclusive control and management of\nthe plaintiff-company.\n\n56.      Admittedly, till date no rectification application has been filed\nby defendant no.1 and plaintiff has spent huge amounts of money on\nexpanding its business, advertising and defending the marks by filing\nsuits.\n\n57.      The defendant no.1‟s defence that though it had initially applied\nfor the mark in its name, yet the registration had been granted in\nplaintiff‟s favour ‗cuts no ice' as the defendant no.1 was in the\nmanagement of the plaintiff company right from inception till\nappointment of resolution professional on 11th May, 2018 and during\nthis period applications for renewal of the said marks had also been\nfiled. It is pertinent to mention that even during arguments learned\nsenior counsel for defendant no.1 repeatedly emphasised that\ndefendant no.1 treated the plaintiff as his alter-ego. Consequently, the\ndefendant no.1 was all throughout aware of the aforesaid two\nregistrations as well as their renewals and as he has not challenged the\nsaid registrations till date, his right, if any, in the said marks in Class 9\nof theTrade Marks Act, 1999stands, if not extinguished, at least\nbarred by limitation.\n\n58.      Accordingly, as the aforesaid registrations are legal, valid as\nwell as subsisting and in any event as there is no challenge to themCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                             Page 47 of 77either by way of a substantive suit or a counter-claim by the defendant\nno.1, the contentions and submissions of defendant no.1 with regard to\nadoption or licensing by way of TMLA or BT Agreement and/or\ntransfer by way of Deed of Assignment are baseless, irrelevant as well\nas inconsequential and the plaintiff is the exclusive registered\nproprietor of SU-KAM marks in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act,\n1999.\n\nAS THE LICENCE GRANTED UNDER TMLA WAS ―NON\nTRANSFERABLE‖ IN NATURE AND THERE IS NO PLEADING\nTHAT THE ERSTWHILE PARTNERSHIPS WERE ENGAGED IN\nINVERTER BUSINESS, ANY LICENCE UNDER THE TMLA COULD\nHAVE BEEN IN RESPECT OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED\nWITH THE CABLE TV BUSINESS ONLY.\n\n59.     Dehors the aforesaid fundamental reasoning, this Court finds\nthat Clause 1 of the TMLA, states that the licence granted was ―non\ntransferable‖ in nature. Clause 1 of the TMLA is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n60.     It is the defendant no.1‟s case that the partnership firm, to which\nthe licence was granted, ceased to exist and the business was\ntransferred to the plaintiff. Consequently, the use of the SU-KAMCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                           Page 48 of 77marks by plaintiff is not derived from, or under any authority of\ndefendant no.1.\n\n61.   Further, proceeding on the basis that TMLA is authentic, this\nCourt is of the view that it did not apply to the plaintiff and did not\ncreate a licensor-licencee relationship between defendant no.1 and\nplaintiff as there is no reference to inverter business in the TMLA.\n\n62.   Learned senior counsel for defendant no.1 submitted across the\nbar that language in the TMLA implies inverters. However, there is no\npleading in the written statement to the effect that the erstwhile\npartnerships or defendant no.1 was engaged in inverter business and\nno evidence can be led beyond or contrary to pleadings.\n\n63.   In any event, assuming that the TMLA specifically mentioned\n―inverters‖ it would then also not help defendant no.1 as defendant\nno.1 has admitted in the written statement that the two erstwhile\npartnerships were only conducting cable TV business. There is no plea\nthat they were engaged in any other business, let alone inverters.\n\n64.   It is settled law that where a mark is unregistered, as it was at\nthat stage, ownership of the proprietor is not in the trade mark, but in\nthe goodwill associated with the business where the trade mark is\nused. Since the inverter business was never carried out by the\npartnership, no goodwill was generated in favour of defendant no.1 for\nthe inverter business. Consequently, any licence under the TMLA\ncould have been a licence in respect of the goodwill associated with\nthe cable TV business only, since that was admittedly the business\nconducted by the partnership.\n\n65.   Accordingly, based on the admissions of defendant no.1 and\napplicable law, it can safely be said that the TMLA does not cover the\ninverter business and never was and is not applicable to the plaintiff.\nConsequently, no purpose will be served by leading oral evidence on\nwhether the TMLA covers the inverter business.\n\n66.   The statement in the BT Agreement relied upon by defendant\nno.1 refers to his existing ownership rights in the partnership.\nHowever, this Court is of the view that since no inverter business was\ncarried out by the partnership, there was no existing right pertaining to\nSU-KAM marks with respect to inverters. Accordingly, the statement\nin the BT Agreement could, at most, refer to ownership of the trade\nmark Su-Kam in relation to the Cable TV business. Moreover, as\nstated hereinabove, in view of the registration certificate dated 22nd\nJune, 2005 and 05th February, 2011 in favour of the plaintiff having\ncome into effect on 05th October, 1998 and 09th March, 2006\nrespectively, the contrary averment/recital in BT Agreement dated 16th\nSeptember, 1999, is of no legal consequence.\n\nTHE DEED OF ASSIGNMENT IS VOID FOR BREACH OF\nFIDUCIARY DUTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF LACK OF QUORUM\nAS THE VOTES OF DEFENDANT NO.1 AND HIS WIFE WOULD\nHAVE TO BE DISREGARDED FOR BEING INTERESTED\nDIRECTORS.\n\n67.   In the opinion of this Court, the Deed of Assignment is void for\nbreach of fiduciary duty, as it had been executed by defendant no.1,\nboth as assignor and assignee and it purports to transfer the substratum\nof plaintiff‟s business to its Director (defendant no. 1) for nominal\nconsideration of Rs. 5,000/- by an alleged recordal twelve years laterCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 50 of 77and that too after commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution\nProcess!\n\n68.    The Deed of Assignment is further invalid because it contains\nstatements that the plaintiff-company is the licencee of the defendant\nno.1, which is falsified by agreement itself, which is for assignment.\nIf the assertion with respect to licence was true, the Deed/Agreement\nwould be for rectification and not for assignment by an owner!\n\n69.    The Deed of Assignment is also invalid because it portrays as if\nthe plaintiff had authorised it vide Resolution dated 20th March, 2006;\nbut the same is neither legal nor valid on account of lack of quorum\nunderSection 287of the Company Act, 1956 as the votes of two out\nof three Directors namely, defendant no.1 and his wife would have to\nbe disregarded for being beneficiaries/interested Directors by virtue ofSection 300of the Companies Act, 1956.Section 300(1)of the\nCompanies Act, 1956 states as under:-\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n70.    Moreover, Deed of Assignment is ineffective against plaintiff\nbecause it had acquired a conflicting interest in the registered trade\nmark without the knowledge of assignment or transmission as in theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 51 of 77present case between 16th March, 2006 (i.e. date of execution of Deed\nof Assignment) and 09th July 2018 (i.e. when the defendant no.1\nsubmitted the Deed of Assignment to the Interim Resolution\nProfessional), there was no assertion or representation by defendant\nno.1 that plaintiff is not the owner of the SU-KAM mark in Class 9.\nConsequently, defendant no.1 had always held out plaintiff to be the\nowner of the SU-KAM marks which the plaintiff believed to be true.\nIn view of this, defendant no.1 is estopped from contending to the\ncontrary and Mohori Bibee & Anr. Vs. Dharmodas Ghose, 7 CWN\n441 is not applicable to the present case.\n\n71.It is settled law that defendant no.1 cannot be permitted to take\nadvantage of his own breach of fiduciary duty to divest the company\nof its substratal asset as held inGlobe Motors Ltd.

The relevant portion ofthe\nsaid judgmentis reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\nHe proposed that his company should undertake to place\n      them for a commission of 1-1/2 percent to the company. He\n      was held liable to account of 3-1/2 percent. In so deciding\n      Malins, V.C. made the following observations, which were\n      later on upheld by the House of Lords:--\n\n‗Thus a director may be shown to be so placed and to have\n      been so closely and so long associated personally with the\n      management of the company that he will be deemed to be not\n      merely cognizant of but liable for fraud in the conduct of the\n      business of the company even though no specific act of\n      dishonesty is proved against him personally. He cannot shut\n      his eyes to what must be obvious to everyone who examines\n      the affairs of the company even superficially. If he does 50 he\n      could be held liable for dereliction of duties undertaken by\n      him and compelled to make good the losses incurred by the\n      company due to his neglect even if he is not shown to be\n      guilty of participating in the commission of fraud (emphasis\n      supplied). It is enough if his negligence is of such a character\n      as to enable frauds to be committed and losses thereby\n      incurred by the company‖. (Vide Official Liqidator v. PA.\n      Tendolkar, (1973) 43 Company Gases 382 at 384.\n\n10. A derivative action can be brought against directors who\n      are in control of the company to compel such directors to\n      account to the company for profits made by appropriating for\n      themselves a business opportunity which the company would\n      otherwise have enjoyed. (Vide Penington's Company Law 4th\n      Edition, paqe 596).\n\n11.Gower in Company Law 3rd Edition page 526 has noticed\n      that because of the trustee like position of the directors a\n      contract between the company with another firm of\n      partnership of which one of the directors was a partner have\n      been avoided at the instance of the company notwithstanding\n      that its terms were perfectly fair and that in the words of\n      Lord Cranworth L.G. ―so strictly is this principle adhered to\n      that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or\n      unfairness of a contract so entered into......‖. Thus the\n      contract will be voidable at the instance of a company and\n      any profits made by the Directors personally will be\n      recoverable by the company (page 527 supra).\n\n12. Various remedies could be resorted to by the Company in\n      case of a breach of duties by the Directors. Thus one of the\n      remedies provided to the company is recession of a contract,\n      another is accounting for profits. The liability of the Director\n      may arise out of a contract made between a director and a\n      company. In such a case accounting is a remedy additional to\n      avoidance of contract and is normally available whether or\n      not is there recession, (page 556 supra. Gower).\n\n13. A resume of the law would thus clearly show that no\n      doubt theCompanies Actdoes not forbid a contract being\n      entered into by the company with a firm in which one of the\n      Directors is a partners, it is also true that the respondent\n      Director disclosed his interest in the agreement when the\n      same was approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting\n      held on 15-6-1967. But this fact by itself does not\n      automatically prove that the arrangement which had been\n      entered into by the company was not of such a nature which\n      keeping in view the fiduciary relationship of Mehta Harnam\n      Singh, a director of the company should not have been so\n      entered into, thus giving a right to the company to avoid the\n      contract and to ask for the recovery of the profits made by\n      the Director. The test to be applied in the present case is--\n      had the company been a going concern and had some\n      payments in pursuance of this very agreement been made to\n      the respondents could the company have asked for recession\n      of the contract or in case any payments had been made to the\n      respondent Harnam Singh and others, for the return of the\n      same to the company. If the answer is in the affirmative, the\n      claim of the appellant must succeed.\n\n14. We must now turn to the examination of the agreement to\n      find out whether its terms were such which in the words of\n      the Supreme Court would show that circumstances were such\n      that there could be no other conclusion than that the same\n      was arrived at because of the peculiar position, which the\n      respondent as Director, enjoyed in the company.\n\nxxx               xxx                 xxxCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 57 of 77\n\n19. It will thus be seen that out of 13 directors who attended\n      the Board meeting on 15-6-1967, 6 of them were interested in\n      three agreements which were approved by the Board on that\n      day. Technically we may accept what is recorded in the\n      minutes of the Board that the Directors had disclosed their\n      interest in the agreement which was being approved and also\n      did not take part in the discussion or voted on the resolution.\n      Though therefore, there may not be any technical objection\n      to these resolutions yet we cannot overlook the patent\n      incongruity of accepting that unbiased mind was brought to\n      bear on the merits of these agreements when almost half of\n      the Board was interested in one or the other agreement. ‗In\n      such a case the criticism that this was nothing but mutual\n      backslapping to enrich themselves does not sound\n      improbable. As Gower on Company Law in commenting on\n      such kind of disclosures says--‗in marked contrast with the\n      basic equitable principle, the disclosure required is not to the\n      general meeting but to the board. It hardly seems over-\n      cynical to suggest that disclosure to one's cronies is a less\n      effective restraint on self seeking than disclosures to those for\n      whom one is a fiduciary.\n\nxxx                 xxx                 xxx\n\n21. The learned single Judge has not accepted that the\n      contract was without consideration. The learned Judge holds\n      that it was a service contract for the purpose of employment\n      to boost sales and because of this service there was a good\n      consideration even to paying Rs. 1 lakh 20 thousand per\n      annum as a minimum fee. Normally if a party undertakes to\n      boost sales and use his expertise for this purpose on some\n      minimum fee it is possible to say that there was a proper\n      consideration for contract. But it was theOfficial\n      Liquidator's case in reply to the application for arbitration\n      that none of these agencies including the respondents had\n      ever dealt with steel products or had any experience in the\n      line and that this device was fraudulently and collusively\n      adopted to siphen away the company's funds for the\n      individual and personal benefits of the said directors, at a\n      time when the company to their full knowledge was passingCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 58 of 77through a financial crisis beginning with July 1966. It was\n      also stated that they had not rendered any service and the\n      agreement had never been acted upon. Infact Shri B. K. Bedi,\n      the Chairman of the company who had negotiated the sales\n      originally was unable to contradict that the plaintiff firm did\n      not secure any business for the company. He also admitted\n      that the firm was not associated with any other steel unit or\n      any other manufacturing unit. He did not know that they had\n      any experience as manufacturer. The control and the\n      influence that these persons could exercise on the whole\n      Board is apparent from his admission that Directors Kirpa\n      Ram Saluja, Narinder Singh Kohli and a few other directors\n      were even on the Finance Committee of the company and this\n      committee had favoured the grant of selling agency to the\n      respondent. Thus it is crystal clear that it is a case where the\n      Board of 13 approved of these agreements, which granted the\n      distribution rights of the company's steel products to 6 of\n      themselves, of course after complying with the formality of\n      disclosing their interest. Had the presence of Directors been\n      the only objection but the terms on which the agreement was\n      entered into showed some kind of fairness and business\n      arrangement normally expected of an ordinary business man,\n      it might have been still possible to uphold the agreement. But\n      the terms incorporated in the agreement leave no manner of\n      doubt that the only interest that was kept in view was the\n      personal benefit and profit of these directors and that too at\n      great cost and to the gross detriment of the interest of the\n      company.\n\nxxx                 xxx                  xxx\n\n24. We cannot but hold the terms of the agreement dated 1-6-\n      1967 as approved by the Board were anything but to the\n      detriment of the company. This was an arrangement which\n      was made simply to siphon of Rs. 1 lakh and 20 thousand per\n      annum as a minimum fee to the Directors without doing a\n      single patch of work for the benefit of the company. This the\n      directors were able to do because of their close association\n      and control over the Board of Directors. This was not a case\n      in which only one of the directors was favoured by suchCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 59 of 77arrangement. Six of the directors out of 13 who attended the\n      meeting were the beneficiaries of the arrangement which was\n      also agreed to by the 7th member who was the chairman of\n      the company. This was a case of such blatant unfairness\n      against the company that as the Supreme Court said that it\n      would be obvious to any one who examines the affairs of the\n      company even superficially that there was not one single\n      redeeming feature in the agreement. In that view the\n      company would have been justified, had any benefit been\n      taken by the respondents to ask for the account and the\n      restoration of the amount. In the present case the\n      respondents chose to claim to have the matter referred to the\n      arbitrator. It is interesting to note that in the statement of\n      claim filed before the arbitrator the respondents have prayed\n      for a payment of Rs. 6 lakhs which is worked out at the rate\n      of 10,000/- per month for 5 years, no suggestion of having\n      done any work is even mentioned. This also would show the\n      untenable nature of the arrangement so far as the company\n      was concerned. This agreement is patently against the\n      interest and benefit of the company.\n\n25. We would, therefore, hold that this agreement was\n      vitiated and void and the official liquidator representing the\n      company is entitled to ask for its recession. As we are\n      satisfied that this agreement of 1-6-1967 which was approved\n      by the Board of Directors on 15-6-1967 was not in the\n      interest and benefit of the company the same is, therefore,\n      liable to be avoided by the Official Liquidator. In that view of\n      the matter as the agreement is held not to be subsisting,\n      being void, and as the arbitration clause forms a part of the\n      agreement will naturally not survive. The effect would be that\n      there is no existing arbitration agreement and the\n      respondents cannot ask for the matter to be referred to\n      arbitration.‖\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n72.   Consequently, the Deed of Assignment is void for breach of\nfiduciary duty.\n\nSINCE RECORDAL OF DEED OF ASSIGNMENT IS MANDATORY,\nDEFENDANT NO.1 CANNOT RELY ON THE SAID DOCUMENT\n\n73.   Assuming that the Deed of Assignment is valid, this Court is of\nthe view that recordal of the said Deed is mandatory, as held by a\nCoordinate Bench of this Court inRamaiah Life Style Cafe vs.\nEminent     Entertainment    &   Ors.,   CS(COMM)1433/2016,              as\nadmittedly the amendedSection 45of the Trade Marks Act applies to\nthe present case. In distinguishing Section 45 as it presently stands,\nfrom the pre-amendment version of Section 45, a Coordinate Bench of\nthis Court observed in the aforesaid case that non-compliance of\nmandatory requirement to record assignments would amount to\nflouting the law. It was held that any person not complying with the\nmandatory provision cannot take benefit despite such non-compliance.\nThe relevant portion ofthe said judgmentis reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\nLtd. Vs. Suresh Kumar Jasraj Burad2012 SCC OnLine Bom\n      438 has held that though prior to the amendment registration\n      of assignment under Section 45 could not be said to be a\n      mere formality but is so after the amendment.\n\n22. One thing which is however clear as a day light on a\n      reading of Section 45 is that registration of assignment under\n      Section 45 is mandatory. This is evident from the use of the\n      word „Shall‟ in Section 45(1).\n\n23. Thus it is mandatory for a assignee of a registered trade\n      mark to apply in the prescribed manner to the Registrar,\n      Trade Marks to register his title thereto.\n\n24. Seen in this light what distinguishes the present case fromSun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limitedsupra and the\n      judgments relied upon therein is that while in all those cases\n      the plaintiff had applied to the Registrar, Trade Marks for\n      registration of his title to the trade mark by assignment or\n      transmission and non-registration was not attributable to any\n      default on the part of the plaintiff therein, the plaintiff herein\n      for the last nearly eight years from the date of the claimed\n      assignment and for the last nearly five years since the\n      admitted knowledge of claimed infringement has not even\n      applied to the Registrar of the Trade Marks for registering\n      the assignment of trade mark in its favour. The possibility of\n      the plaintiff not doing so for reasons not spelled out before\n      this Court cannot be ruled out. The fact that the plaintiff has\n      not chosen to make M/s Ramaiah Developers & Builders (P)\n      Ltd. as a party to this suit also raises doubt as to the validity\n      of the assignment, on the basis whereof this suit for\n      infringement has been filed.\n\n25. Even otherwise, I am of the opinion that if this Court\n      inspite of such delays and neglect on the part of the plaintiff\n      grants to the plaintiff all the benefits and privileges to which\n      a registered proprietor is entitled to, the same would amountCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 64 of 77to this Court allowing mandatory provisions of the statute to\n      be flouted and/or not penalising the plaintiff therefor, making\n      the statutory provisions otiose.‖\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n74.   Consequently, defendant no.1 cannot rely on a document that\nwas mandatory to register. Further, inSun Pharmaceuticals\nIndustries Limited(supra) application for recordal was filed in 2000\nfor a 1998 assignment and delay in recordal was by the trade marks\nregistry, whereas in the present case the application for recordal is\nmade after more than twelve years, after commencement of Corporate\nInsolvency Resolution Process, on 18th July, 2018.\n\nDEFENDANT NO.1 IS ESTOPPED FROM LEADING EVIDENCE\nOF HIS TITLE TO THE SU-KAM MARKS IN RESPECT OF CLASS 9,\nIN VIEW OF HIS REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE PLAINTIFF IS\nTHE EXCLUSIVE OWNER.\n\n75.   This Court is also of the opinion that defendant no.1 is estopped\nfrom leading evidence of his title to the SU-KAM marks in respect of\nClass 9, in view of his representations to the plaintiff and the world at\nlarge that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner, on which plaintiff had\nrelied by expanding its business and by spending money on\nadvertisements and promoting its business under the impugned mark.\n\n76.   In fact, just seven days before the Deed of Assignment plaintiff\napplied for registration of mark (i.e. on 09th March, 2006) and just\nfifteen days after, defendant no.1 held out to plaintiff and Reliance\nIndia Power Fund (i.e. on 31st March, 2006) that the company was the\nowner of the trade mark in question. Though the Share SubscriptionCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 65 of 77Cum Shareholders Agreement gives status of trademarks and\nregistrations in an annexure being Exhibit H as on 27th February,\n2006, yet the covenant in the said Agreement dated 31st March, 2006\nclearly stipulates that all products and names listed in Exhibit H are\nowned and held by the plaintiff company and ―All rights to\nIntellectual Property are owned exclusively by the Company\n(Plaintiff), free and clear of any encumbrances, and no other person\nhas any right or interest in or license to use or right to license others\nto use any of them.‖\n\n77.   In any event, the SU-KAM marks with respect to inverters in\nClass 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999were subsequently renewed by\nthe plaintiff-company on 05th October, 2008 and 09th March, 2016\nwhen defendant no. 1 was in its control and management.\n\n78.   A suit had also been filed in 2015 for infringement of the SU-\nKAM marks by the plaintiff when the defendant no.1 was the\nManaging Director of the plaintiff company and held more than eighty\nper cent of its shares.    In the said suit, filed under the aegis of\ndefendant no.1, plaintiff was identified as the owner of the SU-KAM\nmarks. Plaintiff then under the exclusive management and control of\ndefendant no.1 had averred in the said plaint, ―The plaintiff was the\nfirst company in India that started a system for power backup in\nIndia....the products launched by the plaintiff under the mark SU-\nKAM have acquired a high degree of distinctiveness in the country\ndue to continuous, extensive and popular use since a long\nuninterrupted period of more than 25 years making it a well-known\nmark. Resultantly, the mark SU-KAM is today perceived by theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 66 of 77general public as well as by members of the trade as originating from\nplaintiff and no one else. It is submitted that by virtue of the\naforementioned long, continuous and extensive use of the trademark\nSU-KAM and other related trademarks with the aforesaid trademark\nregistrations for the same in favour of plaintiff, plaintiff has acquired\nboth common law rights as well as statutory rights over exclusive use\nof the mark SU-KAM‖.\n\n79.      If the erstwhile partnerships had commenced the inverter\nbusiness and defendant no.1 was resultantly the owner of the SU-\nKAM trade mark for inverters, these statements could not have been\nmade.\n\n80.      Further, when defendant no.1 submitted his bid for the plaintiff\ncompany during the ongoing insolvency proceedings, he had relied\nupon a brand valuation report dated 03rd March, 2015 undertaken by\nErnst and Young which identified plaintiff-company to be the owner\nof the SU-KAM marks.\n\n81.      The Supreme Court inB.L. Sreedhar & Ors. Vs. K.M.\nMunireddy & Ors., (2003) 2 SCC 355 has held that if a man either by\nwords or by his conduct intimates that he consents to an act, he cannot\nquestion the legality of the act to the prejudice of those who have so\ngiven faith to his words or to the fair inference to be drawn from his\nconduct.The relevant portion ofB.L. Sreedhar(supra) is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n13, para 448) The rule on the subject is thus laid down by Lord\n   Denman, in Pickard v. Sears [(1837) 6 Ad & El 469 : 112 ER 179]\n   Ad & E at p. 474: ER p. 181\n\n         ―But the rule of law is clear, that, where one by his words or\n      conduct wilfully causes another to believe the existence of a\n      certain state of things, and induces him to act on that belief, so\n      as to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded\n      from averring against the latter a different state of things as\n      existing at the same time;‖\n\n          ―The whole doctrine of estoppel of this kind, which is a\n      fictitious statement treated as true, might have been founded in\n      reason, but I am not sure that it was. There is another kind of\n      estoppel -- estoppel by representation -- which is founded upon\n      reason and it is founded upon decision also.‖ Per Jessel, M.R.\n      in General Finance & Co. v. Liberator [(1878) 10 Ch D 15 :\n\n82.   Consequently, defendant no.1 is estopped from contending that\nhe is the owner of SU-KAM marks in respect of Class 9 of theTrade\nMarks Act, 1999.\n\nBETWEEN 16TH MARCH, 2006 (I.E. DATE OF EXECUTION OF\nDEED OF ASSIGNMENT) AND 09TH JULY 2018 (I.E. WHEN THE\nDEFENDANT NO.1 SUBMITTED THE DEED OF ASSIGNMENT TO\nTHE INTERIM RESOLUTION PROFESSIONAL), THERE WAS NO\nASSERTION BY DEFENDANT NO.1 THAT PLAINTIFF IS NOT THE\nOWNER OF THE SU-KAM MARK IN CLASS 9. ACCORDINGLY,\nTHE PRESENT SUIT IS WITHIN LIMITATION.\n\n83.Article 58of theLimitation Act, 1963, states that the limitation\nperiod for obtaining any other declaration is three years, ―when the\nright to sue first accrues‖.\n\n84.   The Apex Court inKhatri Hotels Private Limited & Anr. vs.\nUnion of India & Anr., (2011) 9 SCC 126 while interpretingArticle\n58of theLimitation Act, 1963, relied on earlier judgments interpreting\nsimilarArticle 120of the Limitation Act, 1908. The relevant portion\nofthe said judgmentreads as under:-\n\n29.InRukhmabai v. Lala Laxminarayanthe three-Judge\n      Bench noticed the earlier judgments and summed up the legal\n      position in the following words:\n\nThe said cause of action again arose in favour of the plaintiff on 18 th\nJuly, 2018 when defendant no.1 relying upon the alleged Deed of\nAssignment applied for recordal of assignment with the Trade Mark\nRegistry.\n\n89.   Accordingly, the present suit is within limitation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n90.   To reiterate, the intent behind incorporating the summary\njudgment procedure in theCommercial Court Act, 2015is to ensure\ndisposal of commercial disputes in a time-bound manner. In fact, the\napplicability ofOrder XIIIA, CPCto commercial disputes,\ndemonstrates that the trial is no longer the default procedure/norm.\n\n91.   Rule 3 ofOrder XIIIA, CPC, as applicable to commercial\ndisputes, empowers the Court to grant a summary judgement against\nthe defendant where the Court considers that the defendant has no realCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 73 of 77prospects of successfully defending the claim and there is no other\ncompelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before\nrecording of oral evidence. The expression ―real‖ directs the Court to\nexamine whether there is a ―realistic‖ as opposed to ―fanciful‖\nprospects of success. This Court is of the view that the expression ―no\ngenuine issue requiring a trial‖ in Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure\nand ―no other compelling reason.....for trial‖ inCommercial Courts\nActcan be read mutatis mutandis. Consequently,Order XIIIA, CPCwould be attracted if the Court, while hearing such an application, can\nmake the necessary finding of fact, apply the law to the facts and the\nsame is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means of\nachieving a fair and just result.\n\n92.   Accordingly, unlike ordinary suits, Courts need not hold trial in\ncommercial suits, even if there are disputed questions of fact as held\nby the Canadian Supreme Court in Robert Hryniak (supra), in the\nevent, the Court comes to the conclusion that the defendant lacks a\nreal prospect of successfully defending the claim.\n\n93.   The present suit is within limitation as the right to sue accrues\nwhen there is a clear and/or unequivocal threat proceeding from the\ndefendant which invades or jeopardises the plaintiff‟s rights. In the\npresent case between 16th March, 2006 (i.e. date of execution of Deed\nof Assignment) and 09th July 2018 (i.e. when the defendant no.1\nsubmitted the Deed of Assignment to the interim resolution\nprofessional), there was no assertion by defendant no.1 that the\nplaintiff is not the owner of the SU-KAM marks in Class 9.\n\nConsequently, the cause of action for filing the present suit arose for\nthe first time on 09th July, 2018.\n\n94.     In the present case, the plaintiff is the exclusive registered\nproprietor of the trademarks SU-KAM with respect to inverters which\nfall within Class 9 in view of the registration certificates dated 22 nd\nJune, 2005 and 05th February, 2011 in favour of the plaintiff having\ncome into effect on 05th October, 1998 and 09th March, 2006\nrespectively and which were renewed on 05th October, 2008 and 09th\nMarch, 2016 - when admittedly defendant no.1 was in control and\nmanagement of the plaintiff-company. Consequently, the defendant\nno.1‟s contentions and submissions with regard to earlier adoption or\nlicensing by way of TMLA dated 07th July, 1995 or BT Agreement\ndated 16th September, 1999 and/or subsequent transfer by way of Deed\nof    Assignment      dated   16th   March,   2006   are   baseless     and\ninconsequential.\n\n95.     Further the Deed of Assignment is void for breach of fiduciary\nduty. In fact, the said Deed had been executed by the defendant no.1\nboth as assignor and assignee and it purports to transfer the substratum\nof plaintiff‟s business to its director ―defendant no.1‖ for nominal\nconsideration of Rs.5,000/- by an alleged recordal twelve years\nlater and that too after commencement of corporate insolvency\nresolution process!\n\n96.In view of judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court inRamaiah Life Style Cafe(supra) as the Deed of Assignment has not\nbeen registered/recorded, the defendant no.1 cannot rely upon the\nsame.\n\n97.   The said deed is also invalid on account of lack of quorum\nundersection 287of the Company Act, 1956 as the votes of two out of\nthree directors namely, defendant no.1 and his wife would have to be\ndisregarded for being beneficiaries/interested directors by virtue ofsection 300of the Companies Act, 1956.InGlobe Motors Ltd.(supra), a Division Bench of this Court has held that a director cannot\nbe permitted to take advantage of his own breach of fiduciary duty to\ndivest the company of its substratal asset.\n\n98.   The defendant no. 1 is also estopped from leading evidence of\nhis title to the SU-KAM marks in respect of Class 9, in view of the\nrepresentations [in particular the applications for registration of the\nsaid marks dated 5th October, 1998, 9th March, 2006, as well as\napplications for renewal of marks dated 5th October, 2008 and 9th\nMarch, 2016, the Shares Subscription-cum-Shareholders Agreement\nwith Reliance India Power Fund dated 31st March, 2006, a suit for\ninfringement of SU-KAM marks filed in 2015 before this Court and a\nBrand Valuation Report by Ernst & Young dated 03rd March, 2015 -\nwhen defendant no. 1 was in management and control of the plaintiff-\ncompany and held more than 80 per cent of its shares] to the world at\nlarge that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner on which representations\nthe plaintiff relied by expanding its business and by spending money\non advertisements as well as promoting its business under the\nimpugned marks.\n\n99.   Consequently, the admissions of defendant no.1 in documents\nand pleadings prevent him from taking factual positions to the\ncontrary and leading evidence to the contrary.       Further from theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 76 of 77pleadings and material on record, it is apparent that the defendants\nhave no real prospect of defending the allegations made by the\nplaintiff and there is no compelling reason for trial.\n\n100. Keeping in view the aforesaid findings and mandate of law,\npresent suit is decreed in accordance with prayers (a) to (f) of the\namended prayer clause, but without any order as to costs. All pending\napplications also stand disposed of.\n\n101.   Registry is directed to prepare the decree sheet accordingly.\n\nMANMOHAN, J\nOCTOBER 30, 2019\njs/rn/KACS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 77 of 77"

        "content": "There were 1,829 press releases posted in the last 24 hours and 402,830 in the last 365 days.\n\nMr. Kunwer Sachdev is the Founder of One of the most well-known brand in Power Back-up Industry â Su-Kam Power Systems Limited and the Mentor of Su-vastika Solar. Kunwer is an entrepreneur, marketer, innovator, motivational speaker, thinker, and leader.\n\nKunwer Sachdev has been given many titles, such as âThe Inverter Man of Indiaâ and âThe Solar man of India.âÂ  He founded Su-Kam Power Systems Limited in the year 1998 and was associated with the company in one capacity or another till April 2018.Â  As of today, he is mentoring up-and-coming Power Backup & Storage companySu-vastikaPower Systems Private Limited (Hereinafter âSu-vastikaâ).\n\nIntroducing the man behind the power backup revolution in India.\n\nKunwer Sachdevis an entrepreneur, marketer, innovator, motivational speaker, thinker, and leader. He revolutionized the power backup sector in India with innovative and user-friendly products that made India-made inverters a household name not just in India but also in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asian countries, including Bangladesh and Nepal. Due to his contributions to the inverter/UPS and solar sector, he is also referred to as âThe Inverter Man of Indiaâ and âThe Solar man of India.â\n\nThe story begins in the 90s.\n\nIn the 1990s, when India was grappling with electricity problems, Kunwer Sachdev was quick to analyze the unorganized market in the power backup industry, which was in complete disarray at the time with substandard products and local players dominating the market. He was instrumental in transforming the power backup industry into an organized sector by training his team, hiring professionals to organize the products and systems, and creating a service setup that was spread all across India, the Middle East, Africa, and South East Asia.Â\n\nPhilosophy is still driving his life which is full of possibilities and achievements.\n\nâThe decisions are not right or wrong; itâs the outcome of those decisions which is right or wrong. That is why I always take decisions considering them to be the important parameter to succeed in life. â Kunwer Sachdev.\n\nTrue to his philosophy, Kunwer Sachdev was able to see the possibility in even the most mundane things in life and find out innovative ways of making them useful to mankind. Most of the breakthrough innovations you see in the power backup sector are his brainchild.Â\n\nHe invented the worldâs first plastic-body inverter, which was adjudged as âInnovation of the Decadeâ by India Today.Â\n\nHe introduced world-class technologies such as MOSFET\n\nHe brought Microcontrollers and DSP Sine Wave into inverters.Â\n\nHe gave âHome UPSâ to India, combining UPS's features and an inverter into a single piece of equipment.\n\nHe introduced Worldâs first touch-screen UPS, which is Bluetooth enabled so that users can monitor it from their phones.Â\n\nHe created the first 100KVA inverter in 2005, which nobody used to believe. He made a truck with having 100 KVA inverter, and it used to travel all across India to showcase our Indian technology called âPower on wheelsâ.Â\n\nHe created the service network having service vans moving all across India to give door-to-door service\n\nHe envisioned a âMake in Indiaâ company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. So in 2003 he made his then-company Su-kam Power Systems Limited the first company in India to export power electronic products to foreign markets. This was no small feat. It was the first time that he toured various countries with hospitable and inhospitable environments, and faced many issues since there was no precedence from the industry, plus the civil situation in many African nations was unstable, Still, he persevered to make a mark for his products and his country. He swept the international markets in the Middle East, Africa, Bangladesh, and Nepal, where his products are loved for their quality and reliability â so much so that Chinese and American products were completely ousted from these markets.Â\n\nEven today, Indian inverters and UPS are preferred over Chinese, and for that, huge credit goes to his efforts.Â\n\nTenure with Su-Kam Power Systems Private LimitedÂ Â\n\nUnder the able guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, the company kept expanding quickly and became widely known for its expertise in the solar energy industry. In fact, it also became widely known for filing the largest number of patents in the power backup industry, with, on average, two patents being filed each month â including 76 technology patents in India, the United States, and other countries. This was greatly influenced by Kunwer Sachdevâs innovative mindset and ambitions.Â  During his tenure, the company became the first to launch plastic body inverters, a product that made it on the list of the top ten innovations of the decade in 2010. The company also introduced innovative products, including Indiaâs first touchscreen Solar PCU with an MPPT solar charge controller that could be controlled remotely using a smartphone and wifi. It likewise introduced solar streetlights using built-in lithium-ion batteries.Â\n\nDue to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited went into bankruptcy and Kunwer Sachdev became embroiled in several legal battles and was compelled to leave and disassociate himself from what he considered his own for 32 years of his career.Â  The legal battles of a single entrepreneur who changed the map of the power backup sector in India continue to date.Â\n\nThe turnaround and a new beginning.\n\nThe exit of Kunwer Sachdev from the company he founded and ran from its inception till 2018 left a vacuum for the customers, distributors, suppliers, and others connected with the company. Dealers and distributors, along with the customers, were suffering on one side of the services and materials lying with them unsold, and the customerâs warranty claims were left without any solution.Â  In these circumstances, after much struggle and challenges, his wife, Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help and give services to the hapless customers left in the lurch by insolvency proceedings.Â  With a lot of help and support from friends, distributors, and employees, Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev.Â  Joining Su-vastika as a Mentor.\n\nThe products built by Kunwer Sachdev at Su-vastika outsmart many others due to their easy handling and ruggedness. His products do not need any artificial environment like air conditioning; they can work from sub-zero to 55-degree centigrade.\n\nWith the speed at which Kunwer Sachdev and his team were building new technologies, he knew he had to do something to protect them. Thus, he started filing patents and, by doing so, became the first Indian entrepreneur to file for technology and design patents in the Indian power backup Industry.Â\n\nUnder his able guidance, Su-vastika made a record for being the only company in the power backup industry to file for over 60 patents, with nearly 2 technology patents filed in a month. At Su-vastika he is continuously coming up with newer patent ideas, not just in the inverter industry but in many other fields related to energy, artificial intelligence, communications, and many more.\n\nHis strong business acumen and foresightedness help him to gauge the vast opportunities in the solar sector, where he is completely immersed in. He started working passionately in building world-class solar products and developed some unique solar products that suit the needs of everyone, from a small house in a remote village to big industries.Â\n\nWith a towering personality like Kunwer Sachdev and his able mentorship, Su-vastika is constantly building new technologies and filing patents.\n\nSome of the key products developed by Kunwer Sachdev as a mentor of Su-vastika include being sold under the Su-vastika brand are:Â\n\nEnergy Storage SystemsÂ  :Â  Su-vastika grid-connected energy storage system can support a grid 24Ã7 by providing frequency and voltage support. ESS can be a great resource for renewable energy (RE) and electric vehicle (EV) integration with the electricity distribution grid.\n\nEmergency Rescue Devices:Â  Emergency Rescue Device/ERD is an elevator-installed mechanism that acts during power shortages that limit the liftâs performance. In the event that the main power source fails, this emergency equipment supplies a 3-phase power supply to the elevators.\n\nLiFePO4-based batteries :Â  Su-vastika has designed a lithium-ion battery bank that is one of its kind and will completely go to improvise the battery industry as well as the Electric vehicle industry too. LiFePO4 batteries have a lower energy density and operate at lower voltages than lithium-ion batteries. They have a lower discharge rate and flat curves and are safer than Li-ion batteries.\n\nAutomated Testing Setup: Su-vastika has designed an in-house Automatic Testing Setup (ATS).Â\n\nATS aids in high-quality manufacturing and testing of UPS/Inverters, solar inverters, on-grid and off-grid, and hybrid solar inverters for single-phase and 3-phase technology.Â\n\nTheir Automatic Testing set-up includes Electrical vehicle testing machines for the manufacturing of 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers as well as for repairing these EVs\n\nLithium battery testing machines for testing the BMS (Battery Management Solution) as well as testing the whole lithium bank from 12 V to 600 V DC bankÂ\n\nFunctional PCB Testing machines that are universal in nature. All these machines are developed on online monitoring solutions so that one can see the data online and store the important information for future traceability\n\nSolar Compatible EV Chargers: With the push for electric vehicles all over the world, it is more important than ever to think about the source of power. If the electricity a customer is using to charge their electric vehicle is coming from is coal-powered, it is not essentially solving the problem of climate change. Su-vastika has developed solar-powered EV chargers that make power generation clean and pollution free in the true sense.\n\nâI wish to see every household in India get powered by solar energy. I want every business, big or small, to invest in solar energy and reap the seamless benefits of this natural resource.â Kunwer Sachdev\n\nKunwer Sachdev is once again revolutionizing the power backup sector in India. With so many innovations he is doing with LiFePO4 batteries, he is set to acquire a new title, âThe Lithium Man of India.â\n\nMedia ContactCompany Name:CbheraldContact Person:ManishEmail:Send EmailCity:New YorkCountry:United StatesWebsite:cbherald.com\n\nÂ\n\nPress Release Distributed byABNewswire.comTo view the original version on ABNewswire visit:Kunwer Sachdev, The Inverter Man Of India Is Back\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\n\nEIN Presswire provides this news content \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.

        "content": "Founder & CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems\n\nFebruary 11, 2015 6:12 am/2 Commentson “Make in India” to reduce India’s electronics import bill\n\nMake in Indiais the biggest initiative launched by our Prime Minister to attract investors to our country and to encourage them to manufacture in India. This one campaign will provide the much needed boost to India’s economy by creating jobs, making India a self reliant economy and getting the country its rightful place under the sun. The Prime Minister has also set very high targets for the focus sectors.\n\nMrKunwer Sachdeva, Managing Director Su-Kam Power Systems, while speaking to a team fromIndia Infoline(IIFL) lauded the Prime Minister’s initiative, especially in the Solar Sector. Under the National Solar Mission, the Prime Minister has enhanced the goal from 20 GW of solar energy by 2020 to 100 GW, a huge step. Mr Sachdev believes that this target though achievable would require a slew of investors, manufacturers, and other involvement of many stakeholders.\n\nThe Inverter Man of India is very upbeat about India’s performance based on the steps taken byNarendra Modi. A number of new technologies are being developed in India. Su-Kam well symbolises Make in India – for over 15 years now the company has been innovating and manufacturing in India. The company holds close to 100 design patents in India, USA and other countries, and over 100 technology patents. Today the company files a minimum of 30 patents a year. However, Mr Sachdeva believes that the Patent granting system in the country leaves a lot to be desired. The patents that Su-Kam has filed for over six years ago are yet to be granted. In today’s dynamic world technology changes very fast and some of these have already become obsolete.\n\nThis needs to be fixed very quickly. Having said that there is no doubt that the Make in India initiative will ensure that a large number of companies start manufacturing in India, thus generating employment and improving the standard of living in the country.\n\nMr Sachdeva also believes that this initiative can have a major impact at India’s macro-economic picture. For instance, if we were to only focus on the electronics industry, there is much that can be achieved. According to industry experts, India’s electronic imports may surpass its oil import bill by 2030. Keeping the current oil prices in view, this aim may also be achieved by 2025. Currently the annual imports stand at over USD 35 billion!\n\nFirm laws and a fast paced administrative machinery are critical to the success of the Make in India campaign, said Mr Kunwer Sachdev while speaking to the IIFL team.\n\nJanuary 12, 2015 6:00 am/16 Commentson Inverter Man of India – Always a Step Ahead!\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev has been aptly given the title of the “Inverter Man of India”. Frustrated over a malfunctioning inverter at his house he opened the inverter and studied the reasons for its continuous failure. Little did he know then that he was taking the first step toward revolutionising an industry that was highly unorganised.\n\nWhen he opened that inverter,Kunwer Sachdevaalso did not realise that with that one action he was about to script his life’s story of rags to riches. Mr Sachdev hails from a very humble background and spent his early career selling pens. He faced numerous challenges at every step, however he never deterred, building his company from strength to strength. He always searched for an opportunity when faced with a problem, rather than giving up he tried to find a solution and move ahead.\n\nThoughKunwer Sachdevhad no formal training in electronics or an engineering degree, he built a power backup solutions company known globally for products backed by world class technology. Mr Sachdeva’s vision, entrepreneurial capability and determination led him to build Su-Kam into a Superbrand.\n\nAn innovation driven company, Su-Kam is always a step ahead of the industry.Kunwer Sachdeva, who built Su-Kam into a Rs 1000 crore plus company realised early on that Solar is the answer to India’s growing power needs. Su-Kam has a very strong R&D which is constantly working on developing innovative solar solutions. That day is perhaps not far when the Inverter Man of India will get renamed as the Solar Man of India.\n\nNovember 28, 2014 11:08 am/27 Commentson The Inverter Man of India runs the Airtel Half Marathon\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev, also known as the Inverter Man of India, ran the Airtel Half Marathon on November 23, 2014 in Delhi. Achieving a time of 2hrs 21 mins, he ran 21 kms. Mr Sachdev is an avid sports person and a swimmer. He found the time to run the marathon despite his busy schedule, as he was determined to do so this year.Mr Kunwer Sachdeva believes in the saying “”Finishing a marathon is a state of mind that says ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE”. Running the marathon has been just that for him – breaking a mental barrier that it is difficult to run 21 kms at a stretch.\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdeva has lived his life by the saying “Anything is Possible” – overcoming challenges and proving it right over and over again. Coming from a very humble background, Mr Kunwer Sachdeva has built a Rs. 1200 crore company. Though academically he is not a technical person, he is credited with transforming the inverter industry from a non-technical industry into a highly technologically advanced industry!\n\nEven after running the half marathon, Mr Sachdeva’s batteries were as charged as those manufactured by his company.

        "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention. It mostly consists of the \"Bharat Shiromani\" award given by the Indian government and the Ernst & Young \"Best Industrialist of the Year\" honor.  Kunwar Sachdev's biography, it is clear that talent alone may make a person successful without needing a degree as you know that despite being successful, Bill Gates and Facebook are former students of Mark Zuckerberg College.\n\nRead More News :\n\nStepping out of the Domestic Threshold, becoming the Richest Mother\n\nIndia's retail king, Radhakishan Damani\n\n© 2025 siliconindia.com All rights reserved.Attorneys Near Me|Attorneys"

        "content": "The introduction of electricity transformed the way our lives for decades, but the growing numbers of shortages and their lengthening frequency made the power backup industry necessary. Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India. The company is one of the most rapidly growing and progressive businesses in the country. Sachdev has been an inspiration to many who have proven that dreams do come true if we put in our dedication and hard work with the right energy.\n\nKunwer Sachdev was raised in the family of a railway clerk in Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh neighbourhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, he started working in his brother’s pen business. Due to continuous power outrage, he quickly understood that there was a huge potential in the field of power backup. With the challenges of a severe power deficit, he decided to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer had a difficult time bringing investment for his business but it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to some issues. He then improved them and made them better than the ones available in the market. After much research, he approached dealers and wholesalers. Even though the market was already crowded with various brands Su-kam’s inverters were unmatched in terms of price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam became the first company in the power industry which initiated exporting its products to the international markets.\n\nHe envisioned a Make in India campaign and his company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. He has also captured the markets in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa and Nepal where his products were valued for their quality and reliability.\n\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n\nKunwer expanded Su-Kam and made the brand widely known for its proficiency in the solar energy industry. However, due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam went into bankruptcy. Its assets were also frozen. All the services were closed instantly. Due to this, dealers, distributors and customers suffered due to lack of services.\n\nAfter so many hurdles, his wife Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help give services to the customers.  Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev with the help of her friends and distributors. The company has been able to give several services to dealers, distributors and customers. Now, the company will be filing for over 60 patents with 6 under their name.\n\nLatest Blogs"

        "content": "The introduction of electricity transformed the way our lives for decades, but the growing numbers of shortages and their lengthening frequency made the power backup industry necessary. Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India. The company is one of the most rapidly growing and progressive businesses in the country. Sachdev has been an inspiration to many who have proven that dreams do come true if we put in our dedication and hard work with the right energy.\n\nKunwer Sachdev was raised in the family of a railway clerk in Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh neighbourhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, he started working in his brother’s pen business. Due to continuous power outrage, he quickly understood that there was a huge potential in the field of power backup. With the challenges of a severe power deficit, he decided to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer had a difficult time bringing investment for his business but it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to some issues. He then improved them and made them better than the ones available in the market. After much research, he approached dealers and wholesalers. Even though the market was already crowded with various brands Su-kam’s inverters were unmatched in terms of price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam became the first company in the power industry which initiated exporting its products to the international markets.\n\nHe envisioned a Make in India campaign and his company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. He has also captured the markets in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa and Nepal where his products were valued for their quality and reliability.\n\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n\nKunwer expanded Su-Kam and made the brand widely known for its proficiency in the solar energy industry. However, due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam went into bankruptcy. Its assets were also frozen. All the services were closed instantly. Due to this, dealers, distributors and customers suffered due to lack of services.\n\nAfter so many hurdles, his wife Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help give services to the customers.  Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev with the help of her friends and distributors. The company has been able to give several services to dealers, distributors and customers. Now, the company will be filing for over 60 patents with 6 under their name.\n\nLatest Blogs"

        "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention. It mostly consists of the \"Bharat Shiromani\" award given by the Indian government and the Ernst & Young \"Best Industrialist of the Year\" honor.  Kunwar Sachdev's biography, it is clear that talent alone may make a person successful without needing a degree as you know that despite being successful, Bill Gates and Facebook are former students of Mark Zuckerberg College.\n\nRead More News :\n\nStepping out of the Domestic Threshold, becoming the Richest Mother\n\nIndia's retail king, Radhakishan Damani\n\n© 2025 siliconindia.com All rights reserved.Attorneys Near Me|Attorneys"

        "content": "By Srabani Sen\n\n…Su-Kam—the name was suddenly decided at the college canteen. Not for my inverter company but for my pen business, as in those days I was only familiar with this business while I assisted my elder brother sell pens on the roads of Delhi,” Sachdev starts off to narrate his story, while he lounges casually and relishes his ‘fruitful’ salad for breakfast. “I’m conscious about what I eat, so I start my day with fruits to remove the toxics from my body.”\n\nTaking a generous bite, Sachdev continues, “My story can inspire people to think big. They will realise that anything is possible in life and it is they who can change their own lives. How? If you have the passion, focus and the zeal to grow, no obstacle can push you back. Is that too much to change your life from nothing to something?” Sachdev goes on…\n\nI don’t like to talk about my childhood\n\nI was not god’s destined child. Being one of the three sons of a section officer in the Indian Railways, I had seen all hardships in life. I was an average child—neither any interest in studies nor in sports and games. Physics and chemistry were the subjects I hated, history scared me and I always avoided English. In fact, in government schools, like the one I had attended, there were no good teachers to motivate to do something good. And as I belonged to a middle class family, rather a lower middle class family, everybody was just striving to survive. There was no expectation from me and no attention was showered. I felt all alone in a family of five. In such circumstances, boys usually get into wrong things. But on the contrary, I was a very disciplined boy and the tough and turbulent circumstances made me serious quite early in life, to the extent that I started giving tuitions to those who were one class junior to me. In an effort to meet all ends, my father did small businesses but most of the time he was cheated by his partners and, hence, we grew up seeing several court cases and legal tangles, which affected the whole family mentally as well as financially.\n\nI always try to forget my childhood, although it provided a strong base to my life and prepared the ground where I’m standing today. But I dread going back and living those days again.\n\nHindu College was my best learning platform\n\nI was a naughty child and very stubborn—that I still am—which I feel is a very positive quality and helped me to be what I’m today. Despite not being a good student, I managed to score well in my class 12 exam and got myself enrolled in statistics honours in Hindu College, Delhi University. That was the best learning platform in my life. I did everything I wanted to do in that short span of three years—tasted the bitter truth of politics, played the role of a kingmaker, learnt English as a challenge, and got into an affair for the first time in my life. There were good professors, yet I did not take much interest in studies. I was more of a ‘people’s man’ and became a good leader in college.\n\nI was always shy by nature and the sophisticated environment in Hindu College made me even more introvert. Boys and girls around me came from affluent families; they were sophisticated and always spoke in English. And I, coming from a government school, could not speak in English. I took it up as a challenge and started reading English novels, which really improved my English. I started opening up and made friends. I stood for the magazine manager’s post but lost. But I helped my friend win the post of the prime minister of the college. During my campaign for the post of the magazine manager, I went to different classes to give speeches. On one such occasion, when I was addressing a junior class, I was ridiculed and booed. But that day is still memorable because in that class I found my first girlfriend, Geeta. I may be sounding like a casanova here, so let me clarify—that she was the last one, too, as I got married to her after three years of my graduation.\n\nMy first job was at Nai Sarak\n\nAfter graduation, I joined my elder brother to assist him in his pen distribution business. By that time, he was doing well in his business. He bought his own shop at Nai Sarak and also a car. For two years, I worked with my brothers (my younger brother had also joined my elder brother). However, my elder brother was fed up with my suggestions on how to expand the business. I always wanted my brother to move up from the mere distribution business and create a pen brand bigger than Luxor. But he found my ideas too much to handle. We started having arguments, which sometimes turned ugly. So I had to part ways with him. I always dream big. Small thinking and a blocked mind irritates me.\n\nI moved on. But the uncertain future stared hard at me. I dabbled in various commercial pursuits, including a law firm and a cable TV equipment manufacturing company. I had joined the cable company as a sales executive and learned a lot about cables and sales. But this job was equally shortlived. I had always thought of owning a business. In fact, I was ridiculed by my friends and relatives for airing such an ambition. Nothing could discourage me. Now is the time, I thought, to give a shape to my dream. I started a business of manufacturing cable equipment, with no technical background or management skills. People around me warned that it would not work, but I sported a ‘can do’ attitude and was audacious enough to take the risk.\n\nMy cable TV business\n\nThat was the time when the cable TV boom had just begun to unveil in the country. Anticipating a good market for cable TV accessories like dish antennae, modulators, satellite receivers and amplifiers, I started Su-Kam in 1992 (the name I had decided in college days for my pen brand) to assemble and later manufacture these products on a very small scale. I had the experience of selling these products but no idea at all about the execution of a full-fledged business. I just jumped into the business and then realised how challenging and difficult it was. Till then I was cool in life but all of a sudden life made me serious.\n\nBy that time I was a married man and held responsibilities. There were times when I had no money, not even a penny to buy petrol for my scooter. As egoist as I am, I did not ask money from my wife, so I had to drag my scooter to a friend’s place to borrow some money for petrol. But I took every bit of life as a challenge.\n\nI got the advantage of being an early bird in the cable TV domain and as luck would have it, the brand became popular with cable operators in Delhi. Soon, my products were selling in other parts of north India. As I got a good hold on this business, I also managed to get the exclusive right to distribute products of Echo Star, USA, in India. By 1995, Su-Kam had expanded its operations and was doing respectable business. In those days, I made my first million in cable business. My friends said it was my first success. But I don’t call it a success. I don’t think I’m a successful man. I only kept improving in life. I’m still struggling to be successful. Success is a very dangerous word. To me success is nothing but a continuous journey which never ends. It is like chasing some targets and setting new ones. After achieving one target, the chase for a new target begins.\n\nFailures made me stronger\n\nThere were big failures in my life and whenever I failed, mujhe maaza aa jaata hai. I take failures as challenges and challenges give me the boost. Every time I face failure, I emerge stronger. There was a time when I could not pay salary to my staff for at least three months. There were many such hardships in my life which I see as part of the learning process.\n\nNot having any technical knowledge and not being in a position to afford full time staff, I used to request my ex-colleagues to work for me after their office\n\nhours. But so late in the evening who had the energy to work? Whatever they made it started giving negative results and I got the flak from the customers. They abused me and lost faith in my product. It was then that I started learning myself. I blew off the dust from my old physics books and started reading them once again—this time with interest. I started reading about electronics and I found my interest in the subject. For hours I used to get engrossed in these books. Days turned into nights but I did not have any realisation when I was into some experiments—I used to open up mobile phones and other gadgets, remove all parts and experiment with them.\n\nDuring those days (in 1993) I bought a 20GHz spectrum analyser at a cost of Rs 25 lakh. I don’t think anybody in my place (and financial position) would have taken such a step. But I did. I did not tell my wife about it for 10 years, otherwise even she would have scoffed me for wasting money on a spectrum analyser at a time when she was building pressure on me to buy a house. Even after 10 years when I told her about it she fought with me. But I was passionate about learning and doing things in the right way. For me that was the priority, not a house.\n\nInverter business started off with failure\n\nThe cable TV accessories business had reached its peak and by 1997 the growth had hit the plateau. But I wanted to move ahead to bigger things. Success in the cable TV accessories business gave me the confidence to think bigger and I started believing in myself. I was restless to find new avenues for growth. Suddenly, I got the opportunity and in 1997 I started my inverter business.\n\nAt my home the inverter stopped functioning. Exhausted, I took it on myself and opened it up and repaired it according to my knowledge. There was no inverter brand at that time. I felt there was tremendous business opportunity which was waiting to be exploited. I strongly believed that inverters, if manufactured and marketed well, would become popular in households and small shops. I imported inverters from other countries and studied them. I didn’t have any R&D team.\n\nAn area which has always been high on my priority was investment in R&D. R&D not only enables us to keep ahead of competition but also helps us to bring the cost of production down. I got hold of a technical person and asked him to help me make an inverter. He was very reluctant as he never made an inverter before. But I motivated him for months, and he made one successfully. I went on collecting such people and made them successful. That’s how my R&D team was developed.\n\nVideocon imported a good inverter at that time. We copied that product. But Videocon closed down because of the failure of that product. It wasn’t a smooth ride for us, too. Quality issues kept cropping up. But I modified the product and for one year I did business with that one product. I installed the inverter at my friend’s places who tore me apart when the inverters failed. I personally visited my customers’ houses and checked the inverters. Deep into the night, I used to sit with my employees and experimented and re-experimented with this product and finally made it successful.\n\nEntrepreneurship was always at the back of my mind. I always intended to do something big, always looking out for innovative products. I can boast of my ability of strategic vision and understanding of the market potential. I had no knowledge about the power backup industry but had the zeal to venture into new avenues. Su-Kam started climbing the chart steadily but strongly. Low cost and hands-on approach have been the key drivers of Su-Kam’s competitiveness.\n\nConstant innovation reflects Su-Kam’s commitment towards customers. We have been changing our approach and technology with the rapidly changing requirements of the customers. Taking this strategy further, I started production in batteries. Since inverter and batteries are complimentary products, it will enable us to offer a more economical bargain to the customer. Constant improvement in power protection systems will always be my first priority. Now, we are into solar and LED. While solar business has picked up quite well, we have just ventured into LED. We have started three pilot projects in solar-powered LED lighting—in Nepal, Nigeria and Malaysia.\n\nMy wife is my strength\n\nMy wife Geeta was a topper in the university, and I was so ordinary in studies. As the saying goes, opposites attract, we came closer and became life partners in 1987. Geeta had to elope with me as her parents did not accept our marriage—and they were right—I didn’t have a job at that time, while her’s was an established business family. We first stayed in a small rented house at Anand Vihar, then shifted to Janakpuri. Geeta taught mathematics in British School for 15 years. Today she helps me in my business. She is the HR head of Su-Kam.\n\nMy wife has been a strong pillar in my life, the biggest support through all ups and downs. She understood me and gave me space during my struggling days. Her positive attitude and liveliness stand her apart.\n\nI’m gifted with two sons—Kanav and Shourrya—both studied in the British School. Kanav is now doing graduation from London and Shourrya is in class 10. I put no pressure on my sons to do extraordinarily well in studies and have left to them to decide their future. They can join my business or do whatever they wish to. But if they want to join Su-Kam they have to come through merit. They have to join as an executive and undergo training. They have to make themselves acceptable to the organisation. Moreover, it will be the management’s decision. My sons know that. I’ve not given them the mindset to think that they can just come and take my chair.\n\nThere is a lot of pressure on my sons. When parents are successful, children feel the pressure thinking if they can match the level of their parents. Parents have to make themselves the role models for their children. Today, children question their parents. They can ask you, “what have you done in life? Are you successful in life?” So showing them the right direction in life is by walking on the right path ourselves.\n\nMaterialistic things don’t stir me\n\nI bought my first car in 1989 but my own house came late—in 1998. These materialistic things did not stir me. They were just ‘to be done’ things in my priority list. Once I visited Gurgoan and I liked the place because of its calm environment. I always wanted to stay away from the crowd. I fear the crowd. That’s the reason I never go to Karol Bagh or Chandni Chowk. For work, I can even go into the bylanes of Varanasi but not otherwise. I had already set up my office and factory in Delhi and also bought a land for a factory in Gurgaon. When my wife wanted a house I gave her a condition—house in Gurgaon or nowhere. Initially, she was very reluctant to move out of Janakpuri. But I did not give her any choice. At times, I am unnecessarily stubborn, without any logic.\n\nMy shifting to Gurgaon is an interesting story. On one New Year’s eve, my family and I went to visit our new house in Gurgaon and decided to spend the night there. In the morning, I told my wife that I’ll not go back to our house in Delhi and that she should go and get our luggage and furniture. That’s how I shifted to Gurgaon—overnight!\n\nI’m a creator as well as a destroyer\n\nI’m a simple person and like to believe in people. As a result, many a times, people have fooled me. Many people commit big promises to me and I believe them. At the end of the day, I realise that they were fooling me. I lose my time, money and also faith. But still I like to believe in people and that’s my strength. By believing in people I can ingrain confidence in them. Out of 100, five must have cheated me, but 95 others have become successful because I trusted them, gave them the opportunity to do something, and in the process ingrained confidence in them. That’s why I call it my strength.\n\nI may boast of my ability to motivate people. I believe in giving the requisite independence to people to take decisions in their respective spheres and grow professionally. I invest a lot in people—some become good invests, some bad. Today I’m here because of such people.\n\nI’ve no attachment in life—no attachment with car, house, wealth or even relationships. My penthouse is being built inside the Gurgaon Golf Course; it is one of the most expensive properties in Gurgaon. But who cares? People around me fear that one day I may even leave Su-Kam and get into some other business. They are so correct—I’m planning to detach myself from Su-Kam, too. I’ve already given my reins to my CEO Venkat Rajaraman. Now I’m more of a mentor to Su-Kam, giving direction to it.\n\nI’ll not say goodye to electronics, but am definitely looking for new avenues. I may soon venture into food business under the brand name Su-Bake. We don’t get international quality bread or cakes in India. I want to make these here in India. Do you know that in India breads are made of oxidants which are band? It’s an interesting field and I’ll learn a lot.\n\nAfter a certain age, you start realising that you have done quite a number of wrongs in life. Given a chance I would like to overcome my anger. A lot of times it badly affected my life. I’m a creator and a destroyer as well. I’ve destroyed so many things in life. For example, I’ve created many people from scratch but I’m the one who destroyed them. At one time I was their strength. But the moment I took my hands off their shoulder, they were destroyed. Today, I regret that. It’s not a good thing to destroy anybody. I’ll never do that again.\n\nFive years down the line\n\nI cannot say that whatever I’ve wished I’ve achieved in life. But I’ve no complaints. In the inverter segment, we are very successful in India. We are the biggest Indian exporter of inverters. We have not let China enter the Indian inverter market. But 95 per cent of the UPS market is captured by China and in the next five years I want to take away this market from China. With Venkat and our team, we have taken a pledge—within five years we will take away 50-60 per cent of the UPS market from China. We are working hard on that front.\n\nI don’t plan my career or my life, I take things as they come. I do planning, but more than that I believe in execution. Even before planning I think about the execution part.\n\nI read a book called Good to Great, which says if you have good people with you, they can take you anywhere you want; average people can take you to a certain level; and below average can take you nowhere. Su-Kam has a very good team now which is ready to take a new dimension. People ask me what I do to maintain or retain my team. It never happened that people ever left me. I’ve left them whenever I didn’t want to work with them. What does people want from you—appreciation, freedom, space—and I give them all. But then if somebody cheats on me, I get wild. I know that’s a negative side of me and I’m trying to overcome it.\n\nWhere do I see myself five years down the line? Well. I’ve always been a very confused man, I’m still very confused and will die a confused man. I’m still trying to know myself. Till date, I don’t know what I want from life. I’m lost, looking for something but I don’t know what.\n\nYou cannot predict life. I keep changing the course of my life. Tomorrow I may think of taking sanyas or leaving Su-Kam altogether. That’s nothing unusual about me, everybody knows about that. I want change in life. I want to keep learning in life and trying new things.\n\nI can do anything in life, you just challenge me. I’ve no fear in life as I’ve gone through all hardships and failures.\n\nI also want to play a social role but I don’t know how? I’m not a temple-going person and I don’t believe in giving charity to a temple. If I can change the mindset of a few people, I feel it will be a social work.\n\nGod doesn’t give everything to every one. In fact, he shouldn’t give. If one gets too much he will not value life. He will not work hard to achieve it. My suggestion to the youth would be—be passionate and create an identity for yourself first. Money will automatically come. It took me years to create an image and today that image is working.\n\nThese are a few of my favourite things…\n\nFavourite music: Ghazals by Jagjit Singh (I become very sentimental when I hear them)\n\nFavourite food: Paneer (I can have it for breakfast, lunch, dinner)\n\nFavourite film: Lakshya of Hrithik Roshan (whenever, its shown on TV, I watch it)\n\nFavourite book: Good to Great and Execution\n\nFavourite dress: Jeans and t-shirts\n\nFavourite colour: Blue\n\nFavourite historical figure: Sardar Patel and Lal Bahadur Shastri\n\nFavourite pastime: Playing squash and swimming, reading books, talking on the phone\n\nYour strength: I’m very disciplined, punctual and fitness freak"

        "content": "BUSINESS\n\nKunwar Sachdev is the man who once sold pens door-to-door and worked as a marketer to fund his education before founding a company worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nRitik Raj\n\nUpdated :Feb 08, 2024, 10:09 AM IST| Edited by :Ritik Raj\n\nSetting goals and achieving goals are two different things because winners and losers have the same goals, but most fail and few win. Kunwar Sachdev is one such example of achieving his goal. The saying \"one thought changes your entire life\" is often heard but rarely demonstrated. Kunwar Sachdev, for example, used to make a little money by selling pens door to door. One day, however, he had an idea and decided to invest some money to launch a successful business that is now operating not just in India but also in many other countries.\n\nGrowing up in the family of a railway clerk, Kunwer Sachdev is a dreamer who has become a great inspiration in India's power backup industry. His path, characterized by inventiveness and perseverance, demonstrates the transforming potential of commitment. Kunwar had raised the money for his education by going door-to-door to sell pens. He had given up on his dream of becoming a doctor since he could not get medical admission.\n\nWhile working in marketing for a cable company after graduating, Kunwar Sachdev learned that the industry has a lot of room to grow and that not all challenges must be overcome from the start. He just quit his job and founded Su-Kam Communication, which subsequently concentrated solely on producing solar-related products.\n\nThe company owned by Kunwar Sachdev manufactures a variety of solar products that are in high demand in India and abroad. Kunwar Sachdev reportedly owns businesses worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nBad news for bankrupt Pakistan, after suspending Indus Waters Treaty, Modi govt takes this big step, asks World Bank to...\n\nMS Dhoni's simplicity at friends birthday party wins heart, netizens say 'simplicity level of Mahi is too high,' watch\n\nKajol breaks her silence on her 'haunted' remark about Ramoji Film City amid backlash: 'I've seen so many...'\n\nWorld's first electric passenger plane lands in US, flies 130 km for Rs 700 in just..., its name is...\n\nAxiom 4 mission: NASA announces new mission date, Shubhanshu Shukla to fly into space on...\n\nThis Indian engineer played key role in designing US' stealth B-2 Spirit bomber, later sold its secrets to America's rival, not Russia, Iran, North Korea, it was..., he is now...\n\nKL Rahul achieves BIG milestone, breaks Sunil Gavaskar, Rahul Dravid's records to become 1st Indian opener to...\n\nDiljit Dosanjh breaks his silence on working with Hania Amir in Sardaarji 3 amid India, Pakistan tensions: 'I belong to...'\n\nMeet man who started with small workshop, his father didn't know he would...built multicrore business empire worth Rs 340 crore with just Rs 50,000, he is...\n\nMukesh Ambani, Nita Ambani's 'badi bahu' Shloka Mehta cheering for Akash Ambani during Padel match steals the show, watch viral video\n\nMassive fire break out at banquet hall near Delhi's Motinagar; one person feared trapped\n\nMeet actor who started selling lipsticks, nail polishes after parents' death, Jaya Bachchan scolded him for wearing 'chaddi baniyan', made him star; his name is...\n\nDonald Trump issues first statement after Iran attacks US air base in Qatar, says, 'There will hopefully be...'\n\nIran Attacks US Base: Air India indefinitely cancels all flights over Gulf region after Qatar strikes\n\nMeet Jahnavi Dangeti, first Indian to complete NASA's Space Program, won prestigious awards, now set to go to space in...\n\nSamatha Ruth Prabhu’s class 10 marksheet goes viral, teacher’s note ‘She is...’ impresses netizens who call her...\n\nMeet Akshara Singh, the queen of Bhojpuri cinema\n\nMeet woman who is one of youngest female IAS officers, didn’t use phone for 3 years, later cleared UPSC exam with AIR...\n\nUAE, Bahrain, Kuwait close airspace as Iran launches airstrikes on US base in Qatar\n\nDilip Doshi, former Indian spinner, passes away in London aged 77\n\nViral Video: Iran launches airstrikes on US base in Qatar, incident caught on camera, WATCH\n\nTamil actor Srikanth arrested by Chennai police after purchasing drugs worth Rs...\n\nSitaare Zameen Par box office collection day 4: Aamir Khan film crosses Taare Zameen Par's lifetime earnings, mints Rs...\n\nIran Attacks On US Base: India issues advisory for nationals in Qatar as Tehran launches attack on US military base in Doha\n\nIndia’s arms import decreasing rapidly, revenues from exports rise to Rs..., biggest defence importer is...\n\nHow Sonam Yadav, a labourer's daughter, became star of India's U-19 World Cup winning team\n\nIran Attacks On US Base: Tehran launches missiles at Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, Doha condemns strike\n\nTrade war, tariff, and now air strikes: Donald Trump pushes world to brink of 'great depression'; will it impact India?\n\nThis man served in US Navy, developed business idea in college, built Rs 400000 crore company, his net worth is Rs..., company is...\n\nRishabh Pant-Sanjiv Goenka memes trend again after wicketkeepers' twin tons in Leeds Test\n\nSonakshi Sinha reveals if she fought with brothers Luv, Kussh for skipping her wedding with Zaheer Iqbal: 'I don't...'\n\nArjun Rampal dismisses Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal setting trend of dark characters, talks about his role in Ranveer’s Dhurandhar: ‘Everybody's going to hate...’| Exclusive\n\nMeet man, an Indian, who faced 400 job rejections, began working as security guard, now earns more than Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, he is...\n\nAfter Donald Trump's airstrikes on Iran, who holds power to declare war in US?

        "content": "I was not hopping this event to be successful, the way it comes out to be as this is a Govt organized show all the decision makers are coming and we are very happy to participate in this show. Such shows are good platform for the people to came and explore what’s coming up. As we have the technology and showing the technology at times is very tough, so we bought and put us things here to showcase the market.\n\nWe are already a part of solar industry and biggest rooftop solar setup installer in India. As far as people interest is concerned we lack people to connect to the audients. For my each advertisement I got 500 queries that illustrate the awareness in market. Taking about prospects, first I would like to comment on present status of solar based installations. Most of the installations are either not working or lack proper service, as the people lack in-depth knowledge of the technology and standards resulting is misuse of money, time & resources. We a technology based company provides right solution for the appropriate job & application.\n\nIn my opinion it is not about people, it is about companies. In India we don’t have sufficient companies who can about available solutions and benefits, as this is a coming up industry and we lack technocrat man-power. Su-kam feels that, lots of peoples are required how can go to market and tell them how to go for solar and benefits they will be getting and so we are hiring and training peoples.\n\nCost optimizations have already been done. Generally power is 7.00 Rs per unit for commercial purposes that could be easily covered with a solar system guaranteed. We are analyzing the returns provided by solar based installations, and it comes out in 10 years a solar based system given returns a bit more than investment in property. I think 3-5 years will be a max time span for India to mature solar system resources, systems and man-power.\n\nSu-kam is presently focused on commercial set-ups, I am offering grid connected set-ups to people on very attractive prices and my strategy is to let themselves analysis the benefits. For example, say a people is having a load of 10KW; I installed a project of 1KW on the grid. Customers already have a generator, the unit cost is 8.00 INR and generator cost is 20.00 INR. The customer will sees the benefits in their bills and understand what we offer them rather than theoretical lectures. Further we are working with state-govt projects.\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list to receives daily updates direct to your inbox!\n\n*we hate spam as much as you do\n\nIt is a professionally managed electronics print media with highly skilled staff having experience of this respective field.\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list to receives daily updates direct to your inbox!\n\n*we hate spam as much as you do\n\nEM Media LLP210, II nd Floor, Sager Plaza – 1, Road No-44,, Plot No-16, Pitampura, New Delhi - 11003401145629941info@electronicsmaker.comwww.electronicsmaker.com\n\n© 2020 Electronics Maker.
