    "description": "How many of you would care to look twice at the guy who came to fix the cable for your new TV or even thought he would have a great career ? And that‚Äôs why, no one could believe but one such man could emerge as a game changer of entire industry, a pioneer who would set new benchmarks for the sector, an entrepreneur who would generate Rs. 1000-crore annual turnover from virtually nothing, AND with no formal education in management or technical expertise. Who are we talking about?\n\nMeet Kunwer Sachdev, the man of inspiration, and the man behind Su-Kam inverters!\n\nHe is the man who lit up millions of homes in the country during the incessant power shortages and went on to become one of the biggest inverter manufacturers in India after he launched his company Su-Kam in 1998. For all you budding entrepreneurs, here‚Äôs his story.\n\nHailing from a humble middle-class Punjabi family in Delhi, Kunwer‚Äôs childhood was spent in a small home with his parents and two brothers. His father was a clerk in Indian Railways and mother was a housewife. He completed his primary education at a private school but later shifted to a government school due to lack of resources.\n\n‚ÄúFrom a graduate in statistics to a business technologist is surely an unusual leap, but business was always on my mind. I thought of nothing else while I was in college,‚Äù confesses Sachdev.\n\nFailure has been the cornerstone of every success is what Sachdev believed.\n\nHe first tried to join his brother in the business of selling pens but they soon fell out.  His next career move as a sales executive in a cable company was equally short-lived.",

    "description": "'Inverter Man of India'\n\nKunwer Sachdev's journey with Su-Kam Power Systems was a rollercoaster of successes and failures. It all began with an ambitious young man who had dreams beyond his reach.\n\nEarly in life, Kunwer faced the harsh reality of financial constraints. He sold pens to fund his education and managed to complete his 10th grade. With limited resources and a burning desire for success, he explored various ventures to make ends meet. He even took up the job of installing TV cables in homes, earning a meager income of around¬†2,000 rupees.\n\nHowever, it was during his cable TV stint that Kunwer realized a more significant issue in Indian households - frequent power outages and the need for a reliable power backup solution. In 1998, he made the bold decision to leave the cable TV business behind and set up a small room to begin inverter manufacturing.\n\nWith no prior experience in the power solutions industry, he hired engineers to help him. However, Su-Kam's early days were marred by a terrible tragedy - one of his inverters malfunctioned, resulting in a child's tragic death. The incident dealt a severe blow to Su-Kam's reputation and finances.\n\nKunwer wasn't one to give up easily. To address the safety concerns, he introduced a - the world's first inverters with a plastic body. This marked a turning point for Su-Kam and was acclaimed as the \"Innovation of the Decade.\".\n\nSu-Kam continued to innovate, launching India's first touch-screen UPS.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Su-Kam Power Systems had become India's largest power solution company, operating in more than 90 countries with 100 patents to its name.\n\nHowever, this tale takes a tragic twist. After 32 years of dedicated work, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy, marking the end of Kunwer Sachdev's career. The combination of setbacks, financial challenges, and market forces had taken its toll, leading to a heartbreaking conclusion to an entrepreneurial journey filled with both triumphs and failures.\n\nFollow @thinkwings_prakash for more such business stories.\n\n#Successmindset #informativereels #startuplife #Indianstartups #Startupstory #Sukam¬†#Inspiration #failurestory¬†#thinkwings  #startupindia",

He is credited with inventing the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter, which has helped to make power backup more affordable and accessible. He has also pioneered the development of solar-powered power backup systems.\n\nContact :-\nSu-vastika Solar Solutions Pvt Ltd\nWebsite: https://suvastika.com\nContact: 9711774744\nConnect with us:\nüòä Facebook:   / BatteryGuruJi\nüì∑ Instagram:   / BatteryGuruJi\n\n‚úâ Business Mail: batteryguruji0123@gmail.com\n\nWhen comparing lead-acid batteries and lithium batteries, there are several key factors to consider:\n\n1. Energy Density\nLead-Acid Batteries: Lower energy density. Typically, around 30-50 Wh/kg. This means they store less energy for the same weight compared to lithium batteries.\nLithium Batteries: Higher energy density. Usually between 150-250 Wh/kg. They store more energy for the same weight, which is advantageous for applications where space and weight are concerns.\n\n2. Lifespan\nLead-Acid Batteries: Generally have a shorter lifespan, often around 500-1000 charge cycles, depending on use and maintenance.\nLithium Batteries: Have a much longer lifespan, often 2000-5000+ charge cycles. This translates to a longer overall usable life.\n\n3. Maintenance\nLead-Acid Batteries: Often require maintenance, such as checking and topping up the electrolyte levels.\nLithium Batteries: Typically require little to no maintenance. They have a sealed design and don't need electrolyte maintenance.\n\n4. Weight and Size\nLead-Acid Batteries: Heavier and bulkier. For the same amount of energy storage, lead-acid batteries will be much larger and heavier compared to lithium batteries.\nLithium Batteries: Lighter and more compact. This makes them ideal for applications where weight and space are critical, such as in electric vehicles and portable devices.\n\n5. Cost\nLead-Acid Batteries: Generally cheaper upfront. They have a lower initial cost, which can be attractive for certain applications.\nLithium Batteries: More expensive initially, but the higher efficiency, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance costs can make them more cost-effective in the long run.\n\n6. Charging and Discharging\nLead-Acid Batteries: Usually have slower charge and discharge rates. They may also be less efficient in terms of energy conversion.\nLithium Batteries: Can handle faster charge and discharge rates, and they generally have higher efficiency with less energy loss.\n\n7. Temperature Tolerance\nLead-Acid Batteries: Perform well in a wider range of temperatures but can be less efficient in extreme cold.\nLithium Batteries: Typically have better performance at a wider range of temperatures and can be more efficient in both cold and hot environments.\n\n8. Environmental Impact\nLead-Acid Batteries: Have a significant environmental impact if not properly recycled. Lead is toxic and can be harmful if released into the environment.\nLithium Batteries: Less harmful to the environment if properly recycled, but they do involve the mining of lithium and other metals, which has its own environmental concerns.\n\n9. Applications\nLead-Acid Batteries: Commonly used in automotive starting applications, backup power supplies, and in situations where cost is a major factor.\nLithium Batteries: Preferred for modern applications requiring high energy density and longer lifespans, such as in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and renewable energy storage.\nIn summary, lithium batteries offer better performance, efficiency, and longevity, but at a higher initial cost. Lead-acid batteries are more cost-effective upfront and are suitable for applications where space and weight are less critical.\n\n#suvastika #essenergystoragesystem #solar #solarplant #utl",

    "description": "Su-vastika Lift Inverter: Never Get Stuck Again in a lift. Su-vastika  storage solutions company is mentored by Kunwer Sachdev known as Inverter man of India.\nA lift inverter, also known as an elevator inverter or Lift UPS, is a device that provides backup power to an elevator in the event of a power outage. It does this by converting DC power from batteries into AC power and converting the AC power to DC power to charge the batteries. It can run the elevator/lift motor and a complete lift on the battery power. \n\nLift inverters typically have three main components: a charger, an inverter, and batteries. The charger converts AC power from the mains into DC power, then stored in the batteries. The Inverter converts DC power from the batteries back into AC power, which can then be used to run the elevator motor.https://suvastika.com/what-is-emergency-rescue-device/\n\nWhen there is a power outage, the charger stops converting AC power into DC power. The Inverter then switches to battery mode and converts DC power from the batteries into AC power. This AC power is then used to run the elevator motor.\n\n\nLift inverters can provide backup power for a while, typically several hours. The amount of backup time available will depend on the size of the batteries and the load on the elevator.\n\nLift inverters offer many advantages over other backup power for elevators, such as diesel generators. They are more compact and quieter than diesel generators and do not produce emissions. Lift inverters are also more reliable than diesel generators and require less maintenance.\n\nAs a result of these advantages, lift inverters are becoming increasingly popular as a backup power solution for elevators. They offer a safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly way to keep elevators running during a power outage.\n\n\nHere are some of the benefits of using a lift inverter:\n\nProvides backup power in the event of a power outage\n\nCompact and quiet\n\nNo emissions\n\nReliable and requires less maintenance\n\nThe only challenge is that lift Inverter works when a power outage happens. It stops the lift, and then it starts, and there is a time lapse which stops the lift. This is a power backup for lift and called Lift UPS. Emergency Rescue Device or Lift Inverter which works on battery backup system whether Lead Acid or Lithium battery backup.\n\n\n\nVisit Us: https://www.suvastika.com/\nEmail Us: info@suvastika.com\nContact Us: 1800-202-4423\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SuvastikaSystems\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/su-vastika-systems-private-limited/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/suvastikasystems/\n#su vastika",

    "description": "Su-vastika's Lithium Energy Storage System is the best alternative to diesel generators in providing power backup for industrial and commercial loads.\nIn this video, the two people are talking about alternative to the diesel generator, and the other person is explaining the existence of the lithium battery energy storage system and the benefits of the diesel generator. How can the ESS replace the large DG sets and run a similar load? The ESS gives uninterrupted power and is a clean and green power. No diesel or maintenance is required. The knowledge given in this video about the alternative to DG generator is very informative for the viewers. Innovation done by Su-vastika by launching indigenous Lithium ESS made in India.\n\nThe Energy Storage System (ESS), developed by Su-vastika, is a rechargeable lithium battery system that stores energy from the electric grid or any renewable energy source and returns that energy when needed. The Su-vastika ESS is an alternative to DG Generators and can replace small to big Diesel Generators with Lithium battery Energy Storage Systems. Delhi NCR has banned the DG sets, so ESS is the best choice for these areas. \n\nThe primary component of an ESS is a LiFEPO4-based battery.\n\nIt is maintenance-free and noise-free. It does not cause air pollution, requires no diesel fuel to work and takes very less space to install. This doesn't create any vibrations for the building and clean and green technology. The ESS is charged through the grid or solar panels and can generate power through the solar panels.\n\nWatch the video to learn more about this feature.\n\nContact Suvastika Company -\nWebsite: https://suvastika.com\nContact: 9711774744\n\nSocial Media Website Pages Links:\n1.

    "description": "In this video short Mr. Kunwer Sachdev founder Su-kam is showing how the waveform coming from the grid and the waveform coming from Su-vastika Inverter is having difference.\n\"Sine-wave Inverter Vs Square-wave Inverter Explained\" provides a concise comparison between sine-wave and square-wave inverters, highlighting their differences in waveform output, efficiency, and suitability for various appliances.‚Äã\n\nKey Points Covered:\n\n1) Waveform Output: Sine-wave inverters produce a smooth, consistent wave similar to utility-supplied electricity, making them ideal for sensitive electronics. Square-wave inverters, on the other hand, generate a more abrupt waveform, which may not be suitable for all devices.‚Äã\n\n2) Efficiency and Compatibility: Sine-wave inverters are generally more efficient and compatible with a wider range of appliances, including those with inductive loads like refrigerators and air conditioners. Square-wave inverters are typically less efficient and may cause issues with certain equipment.‚Äã\n\n3) Cost Considerations: While sine-wave inverters tend to be more expensive due to their complexity and performance benefits, square-wave inverters are often more affordable but come with limitations in performance and compatibility.\n\nFor further queries:\nContact: Su-vastika Systems Pvt.

    "description": "Discovery channel presents SunFuel India - the best ever documentary made on how solar is bringing light and happiness to the lives of millions of underprivileged Indians who live in remote areas. Indian villagers who never had access to electricity now enjoy 24x7 power thanks to solar installed by India's largest solar company, Su-Kam. Be prepared to have tears of joy as you watch the movie. Yes, there is hope for India. \n\nIt follows the story of a young boy named Raju who lives in a remote village in Uttar Pradesh but dreams of becoming a doctor someday. But how can he study when there is no electricity in the night? A small solar system is going to change his life forever. Then the movie introduces us to a young to-be mother in Tripura who safely delivers baby at a health care centre which earlier had to deliver babies in candlelight. And then we are taken to the modern city of Chandigarh who has proudly installed India's first largest solar power system which runs 1MW of electrical load at Punjab Engineering College.\n\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn- https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta...\n\nFollow us on our Twitter Solar page- https://twitter.com/search?q=SU-KAM%2...\n\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page- https://www.facebook.com/Sukampowersy...\n\nFollow us on Instagram and check out interesting pictures of solar panels/inverters/batteries - https://www.instagram.com/sukam_solar...\n\n\nCheck out our international solar projects 1MW and much more- http://sukam-solar.com/solar-projects/",

    "title": "Ultimate Lift Backup Inverter Solution/Su-vastika #Lift Inverter",
    "description": "This video shows how the Lift Inverter/ ERD is installed in a lift at Gurgaon.\nThe Su-vastika Lift Inverter gives uninterrupted power backup during the power failures. In this video the person shows the working of lift during the power failures and talk about the benefits of Lift Inverter/ ERD called Emergency Rescue device for lift backup. The video talk of difference between Lift Inverter and ARD which is an old technology just to open the doors of the lifts during the power failures in the lift.\n\n1) Backup Duration: The video illustrates that Su-vastika's lithium batteries provide longer backup times compared to lead-acid batteries. For instance, an 80Ah lithium battery can deliver comparable or superior backup to a 150Ah lead-acid battery, highlighting the higher efficiency of lithium technology.‚Äã\n\n2) Charging Efficiency: It showcases the rapid charging capabilities of lithium batteries, which can achieve full charge in approximately 2 to 3 hours. In contrast, lead-acid batteries typically require 12 to 15 hours for a complete charge, underscoring the time-saving benefits of lithium batteries.‚Äã\n\n3) Maintenance Requirements: The video emphasizes that lithium batteries are virtually maintenance-free, eliminating the need for regular tasks such as electrolyte top-ups required by lead-acid batteries. This feature contributes to a hassle-free user experience and reduces long-term maintenance costs.‚Äã\n\n4) Lifespan and Durability: It highlights the extended lifespan of lithium batteries, which can last up to 7 to 10 years, significantly outpacing the 2 to 3-year lifespan of typical lead-acid batteries. This longevity translates to fewer replacements and cost savings over time.‚Äã\n\n5) Size and Weight: The video demonstrates the compact and lightweight nature of lithium batteries. For example, an 80Ah lithium battery weighs approximately 11 kg, whereas a comparable 150Ah lead-acid battery weighs around 58 kg, making lithium batteries more convenient for installation and space-saving.‚Äã\n\n6) Safety Features: It discusses the advanced safety mechanisms inherent in lithium batteries, such as the Battery Management System (BMS), which protects against overcharging, over-discharging, and short circuits. In contrast, lead-acid batteries lack such integrated protections, posing higher risks of accidents.\n\nConnect with us:\nContact Us : 1800-202-4423\nCall Us: +91 9711 774744\nEmail Us: info@suvastika.com\nVisit Us: https://www.suvastika.com\n\nSocial Media Website Pages Links:\n1.

    "description": "Hospital Makes a Commitment to Clean Energy with Lithium Battery System, Replacing Diesel Generator.\n\nThis video shows the installation of Lithium battery based Energy Storage System in a Gurgaon hospital and all the services of the hospital are working on Energy Storage system by replacing the DG set.\nSu-vastika's Lithium Energy Storage System is the best alternative to diesel generators to provide power backup at hospitals.\nThe Energy Storage System (ESS), developed by Su-vastika, is a rechargeable battery system that stores energy from the electric grid or any renewable energy source and provides that energy back when needed. \n\nThe primary component of an ESS is a LiFEPO4-based battery.\nIt is maintenance-free and noise-free. It does not cause air pollution, does not require any fuel to work and takes less space to install.\n\nArihant Hospital in India has made a commitment to renewable energy by installing a lithium battery system that will replace the 125 KVA diesel generator with a 50 KVA lithium battery inverter system. This is the first hospital in India to do so, and it establishes a new norm for healthcare sustainability. \nThis hospital is located in New Gurgaon and is administered by Dr. Shalini Jain and her husband, a paediatrician. https://maps.app.goo.gl/nbApsaxfLwqCjLN69\n\nAccording to Dr. Shalini Jain, the monthly cost of running the diesel generator was roughly Rs 30,000 to 40,000, and the biggest problem was that everytime they needed to operate, they had to first ensure that the generator was turned on. They used to execute any procedure back then. However, with this lithium battery arrangement, they have no idea if there is a power outage. The lithium battery system will offer dependable and clean electricity to the hospital while lowering pollutants and saving money. In the event of a power loss, the system can also offer backup power, guaranteeing that the hospital can continue to operate.\n\nContact Su-vastika -\nWebsite: https://suvastika.com\nPhone: 9711774744\nEmail: info@suvastika.com\n\nSocial Media Website Pages Links:\n1.

    "description": "Su-vastika ESS as a Power backup for Hospital replacing Diesel Generator. First hospital in India by Replacing Diesel Generator to Su-vastika ESS having Su vastika Lithium Battery. Backup for hospital by shifting from DG to Lithium battery by the hospital.\nIn this video the Arihant Hospital is shown where the Lithium battery Energy Storage is installed replacing Diesel Generator. In this video \n \nDr Shalini Jain,  talking about the cost of running the diesel generator was approximately 3Rs 30,000 to 40,000 per month, and the major challenge was that whenever they had to operate, they had first to make sure that the generator was switched on. Then they used to perform any operation. But with this lithium battery system, they do not know if there is any power failure. The lithium battery system will provide the hospital with reliable and clean power while reducing emissions and saving money. The system can also provide backup power in the event of an outage, ensuring that the hospital can continue operating even during a power failure.\n\nArihant Hospital\nX-ray machine\nX-Ray Machine room\nCT Scan machime\nIVF lab\nOperation Room equipment\nPathology Lab Equipment\n\n\nThe hospital's switch to clean energy is a significant step forward for sustainability in the healthcare industry. Hospitals are major consumers of energy, and their operations can have a significant impact on the environment. By switching to clean energy, hospitals can reduce their emissions, save money, and improve the health of their patients and communities.Hospital Makes a Commitment to Clean Energy with Lithium Battery System, Replacing Diesel Generator.\n\nBenefits of the lithium battery system:\nThe lithium battery system has several benefits for the hospital, including:\n\nSafety of Sensitive Medical Equipment: This was one of the major challenges faced by the hospital as they had a lot of incidents of failure of sensitive medical equipment where repairs were required. The lift in the hospital used to stop with a when power outages happened, and now we haven't come to know of any power outages, and the lift is working smoothly on the su vastika's ESS.\nThe Arihant Hospital's commitment to sustainability is evident in its switch to clean /sustainable-vastika Lithium battery/energy and other initiatives to reduce its environmental impact. The hospital aims to become a carbon-neutral facility within the next five years.\n\n\nContact Suvastika Company -\nWebsite: https://suvastika.com\nContact Suvastika Company -\nWebsite: https://suvastika.com\nContact: 9711774744\n\nSocial Media Website Pages Links:\n1.
