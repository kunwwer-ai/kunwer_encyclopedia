      "text": "Born on November 16, 1962, in a modest Punjabi household in Delhi, Kunwer Sachdev's early years were grounded in values of discipline and hard work. His family ran a small-scale business, and from a young age, Kunwer was exposed to the spirit of entrepreneurship. While other children were busy playing, he would keenly observe how business transactions happened at his father’s shop. These early exposures left a deep impression on his young mind. He was a bright student, and despite financial constraints, pursued a degree in Mathematical Statistics—an unusual but strategic choice that helped him build analytical thinking. During college, he was not just focused on studies; he was equally drawn toward business and innovation. He started thinking of branding ideas and manufacturing products under his own label. The name ‘Su-Kan’—a blend of his name and a significant person in his life—became a seed in his mind. Although the pen business he dreamt of didn’t materialize the way he had envisioned, it lit a fire within him. This phase of his life taught him to think big and take risks, even if no one else believed in his vision.",

      "heading": "📦 Starting at Nai Sarak",
      "text": "Post graduation, Kunwer joined his elder brother’s wholesale stationery business in Nai Sarak, one of Delhi’s busiest trading hubs. The business was profitable, but traditional. Kunwer, full of ideas and ambition, quickly became restless. He wanted to go beyond being a shopkeeper. He envisioned creating his own manufacturing unit and building a recognized brand. He spent time designing pens, researching plastic molds, and contacting suppliers, but faced opposition from his family. His father, having seen many struggles, was risk-averse. Despite being grounded in a conservative setup, Kunwer’s entrepreneurial fire never dimmed. A turning point came when a friend introduced him to the cable TV industry. Excited by the emerging technology, he accepted a job in a small firm without even an interview. It was here that he discovered his true passion—technology and electronics. He decided to leave the stationery business behind, a move that disappointed his family but defined the rest of his life. His days in Nai Sarak taught him how to deal with customers, understand pricing, manage logistics, and the importance of packaging—skills that would later help him build one of India’s most iconic power brands.",

      "heading": "📡 From Cable TV to Su-Kam",
      "text": "After a short but intense learning phase in the cable TV industry, Kunwer Sachdev decided to branch out on his own. He had no technical background, but that didn’t stop him. He started installing MATV and CATV systems for hotels and multi-story buildings, sourcing equipment and learning by doing. Gradually, he began assembling his own RF Amplifiers and modulators in his small workshop. These were humble beginnings, with minimal tools and borrowed space. However, his dedication to quality set him apart. He went as far as investing in a spectrum analyser from Hong Kong—an unheard-of move for a small business at the time. That device, which cost as much as a house back then, became a cornerstone in his quest for perfection. As demand grew, he formally launched Su-Kam Cable TV Systems. His products became known for reliability and innovation. The business expanded beyond Delhi into multiple cities. He developed a deep understanding of electronics and realized that his future wasn’t just in cable—it was in power. A faulty inverter at home triggered his next big idea. When he opened up the unit and saw how crude and untested it was, he decided he could do better. And that was the birth of Su-Kam Power Systems.",

      "heading": "⚡Building Su-Kam into a Global Brand",
      "text": "Kunwer didn’t just want to sell inverters—he wanted to revolutionize the power backup industry. He focused on R&D and created advanced inverter technology using DSPs and sine wave outputs, which were rare at the time. His obsession with innovation led to the introduction of India’s first plastic-body inverter, first touch-screen UPS, and even solar-compatible inverters before they became mainstream. Marketing played a critical role. Kunwer pioneered the use of dhaba branding, shikara promotions in Kashmir, and dealer education programs that turned customers into brand ambassadors. At its peak, Su-Kam had a presence in over 70 countries, with a strong export network and over 2,500 employees. The company set benchmarks for reliability, design, and service. But despite the brand’s roaring success, challenges emerged—legal battles, financial hurdles, and management issues led to Su-Kam's decline. While the fall was painful, it didn’t mark the end. For Kunwer, every setback was a setup for a comeback.",

      "text": "After stepping away from Su-Kam, Kunwer Sachdev did not retire. Instead, he doubled down. Along with his wife Khushboo Sachdev, he started Su-Vastika—a new-age power solutions company that embodies everything he learned over the decades. Su-Vastika focuses on lithium battery storage, solar integration, and IoT-enabled smart UPS systems. It is built with a modern mindset: strong IP creation, automation, and a global outlook. Kunwer travels widely, not just to build markets but to understand future trends. His vision is to make India a hub of clean, intelligent energy storage solutions. He continues to inspire young entrepreneurs through talks, interviews, and mentoring. Today, he’s known not just as the 'Inverter Man of India' but as a resilient innovator who shaped two power revolutions. His life is proof that with vision, courage, and persistence, one can rise, fall, and rise again—stronger than ever.",
