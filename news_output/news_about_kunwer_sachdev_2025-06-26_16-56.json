    "snippet": "Solar Man Of India: One of the finest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary businessmen of our time is Kunwer Sachdev, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, Indias premier provider of power solutions. Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.",
    "content": "Success Story: The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.\n\nKunwer Sachdev: Rags To Riches\n\nA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.\n\nSu-Kam- The Unmatched Product\n\nHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.\n\nSu-Kam: Monopoly\n\nThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.\n\nSu-Kam Bankruptcy\n\nSu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.\n\nKhushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In Disguise\n\nCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.\n\nSu-Vastika And The Power Woman\n\nUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.\n\nThe brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did. And he is not done yet."

    "content": "When discussing the innovation brought into the Indian power backup industry, the Inverter Man of India himself Kunwer Sachdev seems to be at the forefront. As the founder of Su-Kam and now mentor of the Indian startup Su-vastika, Kunwer has changed how we view inverters/UPS by converting every problem into an opportunity. Kunwer Sachdev has now taken up a new challenge: to educate entrepreneurs and SMEs to market themselves in this increasingly competitive age. Keeping that goal in mind, Kunwer Sachdev has launched his own personal YouTube channel, where he aims to share his in-depth knowledge of branding, marketing, and sales, helping young entrepreneurs build their footing in the market.\n\nKunwer Sachdev’s YouTube channel stands head and shoulder above other business channels, as it will be full of insights from his own experience of creating India’s #1 inverter/UPS company. Through YouTube, he aims to provide valuable marketing information and practical knowledge that he has gained over the years of developing multiple brands out of nothing. The format is very easy to consume, as he appears in honest conversations both with hosts and the audience, connecting with their burning questions and sharing practical knowledge and insights that no other mentor can provide.\n\nMarketing, Branding, and Building a Lasting Legacy\n\nOne of Kunwer Sachdev’s latest videos on his channel tackles Branding, Culture, and Intellectual Property (IP). Creating something lasting is more critical than focusing only on technical details. He discusses what distinguishes a brand beyond a catchy tagline or logo. To Kunwer, a brand is the story you tell—one that reflects your values and creates a connection with your customers. Advertisement\n\nBut he doesn’t stop at branding. Kunwer knows that a positive company culture is the secret ingredient behind a thriving business. In his video, he highlights how the internal atmosphere of a company—its spirit, its shared beliefs—can directly shape how customers perceive it. A happy, motivated team often means happy, loyal customers. It’s the insight from running a business where you’ve seen all the ups, downs, and everything\n\nA Modern Approach to Personal Branding\n\nIn his latest video, Kunwer delves into personal branding and its pivotal role in today’s business environment. He elaborates how social identity built through personal brand laurels makes it easier to engage trust with the clients and customers in the business. But it is not only an act of self-adoration; the show’s appeal lies in being genuine and genuine only. Sachdev subtly emphasizes that in a world where digital presence matters, who you are as a leader can be just as important as what your business offers.\n\nBuilding a Strong Office Culture\n\nAnother key theme of the video is cultivating a positive office culture. Kunwer talks about how internal business culture can be the cornerstone of a solid external culture that defines employee motivation and organizational image. He breaks the lion’s share of the information on how an entrepreneur can foster a culture that encourages innovation with cooperation to fuel growth. His guidance is realistic and grounded, providing concise management wisdom that can be a good start in building the organizational culture.\n\nSafeguarding Your Innovations with IP\n\nKunwer also touches on protecting intellectual property, offering precious guidance for startups and small businesses. Although he does not go into much detail, he clarifies that to remain relevant in this business, one must protect one’s creative property. As long as business people know the elementary facts concerning IP protection, one can turn into a groundbreaking aspect they never considered over the fear of copyright infringement.\n\nA Blend of Strategy and Experience\n\nNot only does he successfully unite both strategic perspectives in his videos, but he also shares his own experience as an entrepreneur. He invites other business experts to give his viewers a broader view of how one can create and develop a successful enterprise. His advice is theoretical and practical, and he applies these concepts to strategies that entrepreneurs can implement when facing challenges.\n\nDemystifying the World of Digital Marketing\n\nMany novice business owners may need help to handle the internet world. To what extent can a company differentiate its brand? Lastly, an ever-learning Kunwer on YouTube tries to explain digital marketing in easily consumable chunks. His primary concern is to prove that you cannot use vast amounts of money in brand building, not to mention an ad agency’s approval on social media platforms. A clear message, consistency, and an authentic voice would be best.\n\nKunwer also discusses how social media is not just about becoming a screaming chamber and shouting top slogans for advertisements. It’s about conversations, relationships, telling stories, and providing value to people. It is a counsel as fundamental as it may seem implemental for a small business struggling to market itself in a flooded market.\n\nSo, not only is he a teacher, but he also knows what his viewers are going through. He knows the feeling of wondering whether you’re targeting the right audience—if your message is getting through or not. But that makes the advice unique; he has lived it and become a winner.\n\nPractical Tips, Not Just Theory\n\nThe particularity of Kunwer’s channel is that he tells it as it is, refreshing in the seas of polished ‘positive mindset’ content. At one time or another, he couldn’t care less about premising himself on the ability to deliver a barrage of theories which, for all you know, could be filled with hot air; this man is all about solutions; it’s about being practical. Throughout the passage, he talks about how to build a brand story or defend your idea, and, in each case, it is always about what can assist an entrepreneur at this particular time.\n\nHe knows this is a reality for many business owners, that the day-to-day involves doing many different things very often. One minute, the marketer is smiling at you; the next, it’s the customer service rep who is as accessible as your cubical partner, and sometimes you find yourself replacing the cleaner. Kunwer’s videos acknowledge this reality, offering advice that respects the hustle and recognizes small business owners’ challenges.\n\nAnd he’s not just talking to people with fancy MBAs or big marketing budgets. His content is designed for those building a brand from their living room or juggling a side hustle while working full-time. It’s the kind of mentorship that’s accessible and down-to-earth, just like Kunwer himself.\n\nA Community for Entrepreneurs Who Think Big\n\nIn addition to the videos, Kunwer encourages other entrepreneurs who dream big but know it depends on small things. He encourages the viewers to comment on the videos, tell their experiences, and ask questions—thus making his channel not just about streaming videos. It produces a place to get people to learn from, mentor, and befriend other budding business people.\n\nKunwer’s vision for the channel is simple but powerful: He hopes to experience considerable success following trends that apply new modes of constructing resilient, adaptable, and, most importantly, genuine businesses. Looking at the life of Bill Gates, he shows that it is possible to go from receiving very tough tasks from your employers and yet turn them into incremental steps towards success.\n\nConclusion\n\nKnowing how to conduct brand marketing online is essential as the globe becomes more digitally integrated. It’s often a real challenge for most entrepreneurs, especially those newly establishing their own companies, to find reliable and cheap sources of guidance. Kunwer Sachdev’s YouTube channel meets this need, offering a blend of marketing wisdom and entrepreneurial empathy that is rare to find.\n\nBut what is truly remarkable is how, in doing so, Kunwer employs the arc of his life story. He has lived the journey from having a rapidly growing business to facing challenges squarely. Today, he uses that experience to illuminate the way for other people in the same business as him and make it easier for them.\n\nIn an age where it certainly isn’t easy to identify everyone’s niche, Kunwer’s channel is as refreshing as it gets. It’s a place where you can be taught by someone who has been through it and can tell you that the journey is not easy but worthwhile.\n\nTo remain connected, subscribe to Kunwer Sachdev’s YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@KunwerSachddev"

    "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils.

The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention.

    "content": "Image: Amit Verma Kunwer Sachdev, founder and CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd\n\nWhen he turned 15, Kunwer Sachdev began helping his older brother sell pens to shops in Delhi. It was the late 1970s, and the nation’s capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India’s largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices—which he didn’t have access to when he was growing up—that provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.\n\n\n\nPower outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world’s population, don’t have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam’s revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.\n\n\n\nThese days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of replicating Gujarat’s 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It’s also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration—and profit.\n\n\n\nSu-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.\n\n\n\n“We started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don’t have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I’m already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,” says Sachdev.\n\n\n\nHe may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. “We started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,” he says.\n\n\n\nSu-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government’s central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.\n\n\n\n“We don’t sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,” says Sachdev. “Whatever the solar unit produces will get ‘mixed’ into the customer’s normal power supply because of which a household’s bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.”\n\n\n\nSachdev’s solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nSu-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products—which provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily—in 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). “We have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,” says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAshish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam’s solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company’s catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. “We did it in 48 hours,” says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam’s solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. “Peripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,” says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.\n\n\n\nSachdev acknowledges Su-Kam’s not-so-stellar performance in 2011. “We realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,” he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.\n\n\n\nHe’s refreshingly candid about the mistakes he’s made. Perhaps it’s a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. “Few companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,” says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).\n\n\n\nThat said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India’s evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he’s on the right track.\n\n\n\nHe wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he’s also a businessman, one who knows what it’s like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.\n\n\n\nLike many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor’s degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam—a cable TV accessories company—in Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn’t have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.\n\n\n\nBut 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India’s accelerated development at the time.\n\n\n\nIn two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam’s revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it’s hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.\n\n\n\nIn 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra’s Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.\n\n\n\nAlthough Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it’s not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. “People think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,” he says.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India’s slow patent regime for allowing it. “We have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‘Make in India’ plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.”\n\n\n\nA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines."

    "content": "Su-kam founder and mentor at Su-vastika, Mr. Kunwer Sachdev, has shared his thoughts on India's progress in Battery Management Systems (BMS), establishing the nation as a world leader in this quickly developing field. In his most recent article, \"India's BMS Advancements: A Global Game-Changer,\" Sachdev talks about the revolutionary potential of Indian innovation in BMS technology, namely in energy storage systems, renewable energy applications, and the electric vehicle (EV) business. As per Kunwer Sachdev, \"India is set to outshine China in BMS for Lithium Batteries, becoming a leader in the next five years.\"\n\nSachdev, the creator of Su-kam Power Systems Ltd. and a pioneer in the Indian battery sector considers his path and the advancement of BMS technology. Twelve years ago, Su-kam created a BMS, especially for lead-acid batteries. It addressed essential problems like water replenishing and cell balancing, frequently resulting in early battery failures. This early attempt at BMS creation established the groundwork for an industry in India that is expanding quickly, especially with the rise in demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nInnovation and Technological Progress in BMS\n\nSachdev outlines the advancements in BMS technology throughout his article. While today's BMS solutions are driven by specialized chips with pre-loaded features, development once depended on specially developed microcontrollers and embedded software. This led to faster and more efficient development. These developments have enabled a new generation of Indian BMS producers to develop state-of-the-art systems that satisfy the expanding need for lithium-ion battery management across various industries worldwide.\n\nSachdev notes that businesses like Su-vastika, which is creating double-layered BMS protection systems for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), are at the forefront of this movement. These technologies guarantee lithium-ion batteries, vital for electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and electronic applications, as well as safety and peak performance. India's emphasis on BMS protection with many layers is turning out to be essential for improving battery life and dependability.\n\nIndia's Ascent to the Top of the World BMS Technology Market\n\nIndia's BMS producers are ready to challenge the hegemony of China and other international competitors. Despite China's historical dominance, India is becoming a strong competitor in the BMS market because of its advanced technological know-how and domestic production capacity. Sachdev highlights that three crucial characteristics that distinguish Indian manufacturers are real-time data analysis, remote monitoring, and the integration of BMS systems with energy storage.\n\nIndian BMS solutions are addressing the complex demands of the contemporary energy landscape with their comprehensive software and firmware capabilities, enabling smooth integration with renewable energy systems and energy grids. Sachdev also draws attention to the fact that Indian BMS systems provide all-inclusive service and support, setting them apart from many Chinese providers who frequently struggle to provide localized customer support.\n\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship\n\nKunwer Sachdev also talks about how important innovation and entrepreneurship are to India's growth in the BMS industry. He talks about his encounters with forward-thinking businesspeople pushing the limits of BMS technology in India.\n\n\"The passion and drive of these entrepreneurs have reinforced my belief in the potential of Indian BMS manufacturers,\" Sachdev states. \"Their technical expertise and innovative spirit are driving India to the forefront of the global BMS market.\"\n\nOvercoming Obstacles and Gazing Toward the Future\n\nSachdev is upbeat despite admitting the difficulties Indian BMS companies confront, especially in marketing and distribution. He is of the opinion that Indian BMS manufacturers can achieve global competitiveness by means of sustained investment in research and development, strategic foreign alliances, and an advanced marketing strategy.\n\nSachdev sees a time when India leads the world in BMS technology and exports a significant amount of these innovative products.

The objective of the initiative is to promote entrepreneurship in India which is one of the hottest markets after the US and China.\n\nThe Hurun Report has won numerous awards for their ground-breaking lists. Hurun awards were held on December 14 in Worli, Mumbai.\n\nFounder and Managing Director of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd. India’s largest power solutions company Kunwer Sachdev was honored for his exemplary contribution to the Indian solar and power backup industry.\n\nAmong the other dignitaries honored on the occasion were Dr. Cyrus S Poonawala, Serum Institute India, Adi Godrej, Godrej Industries, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Biocon, Byju Raveendran, and Byju’s, Abhishek Lodha, Lodha Group, Rana Kapoor, Yes Bank and the like.\n\nFounded by Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report is a luxury publisher group. It currently has offices in London, Mumbai, Shanghai and LA. The Hurun Most Respected Entrepreneur Award was first established in 1999. This annual award focuses on two growing economies China and India.\n\nThe Award is set up to recognise the success stories of entrepreneurs and talk about their stories on a global platform. Hurun Report India is piloted by Anas Rahman Junaid, MD and Chief Researcher. Its objective is to promote the success stories of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs on global platforms.\n\n“I am honored to receive this distinction. It has been an arduous yet memorable journey. I would also like to thank all my mentors, well-wishers and friends who have been a part of this incredible journey.” said Kunwer Sachdev.\n\nPopularly known as the ‘Inverter Man of India’, Sachdev was the first entrepreneur to file patents for technology and design in the Indian power backup industry. He is also credited with inventing world’s first plastic-body inverter which has been declared as ‘Innovation of the Decade’.\n\nKunwer revolutionised the power back-up industry by introducing world-class technologies such as MOSFET, Micro controller based and DSP Sine Wave into inverters. He also gave ‘Home UPS’ to India which combined the features of UPS and inverter into single equipment.\n\nAnas Rahman Junaid, Managing Director and Chief Researcher of Hurun Report India said, “China and India are the two economies that will lead the world in the next 10 to 20 years. Hurun has been in China for the last 20 years and we have seen how the Chinese entrepreneurs have grown and come of age. We do see a similar pattern in India. So, this award is really about how we are going to achieve that kind of growth story in India. By identifying the patterns in China, we look at those entrepreneurs in India who have contributed in a similar fashion.”\n\nHailing from a lower middle-class family background, Sachdev never let financial constraints bar him from becoming a serial entrepreneur. He started off by selling pens on cycle with his older brother at a tender age of 15 years. He later founded a profitable business of cable TV communications in Delhi.\n\nBeing a visionary, Kunwer was quick to foresee the growth of power backup industry in India and decided to shut down his cable TV business in 1998 to establish Su-Kam Power Systems which is headquartered in Gurgaon.\n\nSachdev is credited with catapulting Su-Kam to the top league of companies in its category within a short span of a few years. Once a startup, Su-Kam, is now an Indian Multinational Corporation, and is recognised as one of the fastest growing organisation among the India Inc. 500.\n\nToday Su-Kam manufactures more than 250 products including various solar products, UPS, batteries, and customized solar solutions. A successful example of ‘Make in India’, Su-Kam has over 75,000 channel partners in many countries around the world. Sachdev has been instrumental in expanding company’s operations to almost 90 countries worldwide and capturing the power market in Africa and Asia.

    "snippet": "But, Kunwer Sachdev, the erstwhile cable guy, is not as comfortable as you would think. \"I am very excited about this new technology I discovered at the GITEX fair 2006.",
    "content": "KUNWER SACHDEV, 40 Education : Statistics (Hons), Hindu College\n\nWorked with : A telecom company\n\nLast salaried job : Rs 8,000 a month\n\nAge at starting business : 23 years\n\nNo. of years as entrepreneur : 17 years\n\nInitial investment : Rs 10,000\n\nSources of fund : Personal savings\n\nCompany : Su-kam Power Systems,manufacturers\n\nof power protection devices\n\nTurnover : Rs 200 crore in 2005-6\n\nNo of employees : 1,000\n\nWho would look twice at the guy who came to fix the cable for your new TV? Leave alone think that he had a great career prospect? But this cable guy, who had just left a sales executive job, had stars in his eyes. Stars that would eventually light up millions, of homes during the inevitable power failures. And from working the pliers in apartment after apartment in Delhi, he now sits comfortable at the helm of one of the biggest inverter manufacturing company of the country, Su-kam.\n\nBut, Kunwer Sachdev, the erstwhile cable guy, is not as comfortable as you would think. \"I am very excited about this new technology I discovered at the GITEX fair 2006. In business you have to constantly upgrade. If you want to move forward, you just can't stagnate.\" Sachdev would know. Creating a Rs 200- crore company from zilch with no formal training in engineering or management, is no mean achievement. He didn't even start with inverters, but cabling equipment. And it isn't as if lady luck really pursued him. It took Sachdev a patient 17 years to set up this enterprise which now has 20% equity stake from Reliance India Power Fund, a private equity fund sponsored jointly by Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Singapore-based Temasek Holdings.\n\nFor a graduate in statistics to a \"business technologist\" is surely an unusual leap. \"But business was always on my mind. All through college I thought of nothing else,\" confesses Sachdev. It may be that repeated failures of his father, a railway clerk, to start his own business, silently motivated the son to accomplish what his father couldn't. \"One lesson I learnt from my father's failure was that career and business don't go together. You have to sacrifice one for the other,\" says Sachdev. And failure has been the cornerstone of every success that he has known. During college, he helped his elder brother establish a business of pens. But they fell out, and Sachdev was on his own. The sales executive's job with a telecom company followed. In 1987 he married Gita, his junior at Delhi's Hindu College, amidst parental opposition. Sachdev moved to a rented\n\nhouse. Gita's teaching job in a school came in handy.\n\nWhat Sachdev learnt about the telecom company stoked his business instincts. By 1989 he was ready to start a cable TV business with the help of a techie from the same company. An investment of Rs 10,000 was enough to get the system going. But while Sachdev quit his job, the techie refused, and for a while the father's story of failure became the son's. Sachdev did not give up hope.\n\nThe going became tougher as it was now a one-man-show- human resources, finance, technology et al. \"To get the work going I took up small assignments of cabling work for multi-storeyed buildings and hotels with two workers,\" says Sachdev, who managed these odd jobs with the advance payments from clients. Gita turned out to be his bedrock of support during the tough times. She would not only manage the house and their first-born but also slip a few notes of encouragement into Sachdev's pockets from time to time.\n\nSachdev's Tips for Aspiring Start-ups BE HONEST WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nIf your product is faulty replace it, that is the best way to win over the customer\n\nREINVEST IN YOUR BUSINESS\n\nInstead of investing in real estate or stocks, Sachdev reinvests in his business\n\nINVEST IN EMPLOYEES\n\nSu-kam organises annual get to gethers for employees\n\nQUICK DECISIONS\n\nSachdev is known for his 'lightning speed' decision-making skill\n\nTHINK AHEAD\n\nDon't gloat over your achievements. Plan your next move\n\nWhen his friend left him, perhaps the biggest handicap was his complete ignorance of the technology field. So Sachdev decided to learn it on the job. Business and learning went together as he laboured on.The first taste of success came in 1991 when the business of cable TV witnessed a boom with the introduction of multi-channels. Each house needed cabling and Sachdev cashed in on this boom. He set up a small-scale unit with six people to manufacture amplifiers and directral couplers - all needed in the business of cablingunder the brand name Su-kam.\n\n\"The demand was huge, players were few and we were quality conscious. We would take back all faulty products thus reinforcing the faith of our customers,\" says Sachdev, who soon expanded his business by manufacturing dish antennas and satellite receivers. \"By 1997 our products were being sold in entire north India,\" says Sachdev. He had made his first million.\n\nIt seems that destiny finally decided to intervene and do a little jig of her own that would spell much bigger success. It was sometime in 1997 when Sachdev's home inverter conked off for the nth time. Frustrated, he decided to take it apart himself to identify the problem. What he saw was not a flawed product but immense business potential in giving the consumer something superior. Once the idea was born, Sachdev was quick to cash in on it. Intensive studies followed and using a new (Mosfet) technology he started manufacturing inverters at his factory.\n\nBut wait, even here destiny did not play it straight. The products were a disaster and all 100 of them were returned by the buyers. Not to be bogged down by yet another failure, Sachdev got a few people from the fledgling UPS industry and focused on technological innovation. He manufactured inverters using a more advanced technology testing and retesting them for failures. The capacity was just enough to manufacture 100 inverters a month but the response for the refined inverters was stupendous. In the unorganised market, his products stood out.\n\nIn 2000, Sachdev took the decision to close down his profitable business of cable TV products and set up his first big factory in Gurgaon at a cost of Rs 15 lakh. His quest to continuously upgrade his products using new technologies made him a clear market leader. A validation of his success came when heavyweights Reliance and Temasek paid Rs 45 crore for a 20% stake in the company. Sachdev is now looking at other futuristic areas such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems, hybrid systems and inverters of over 100 kva capacity. A Rs 80-crore factory to manufacture SMF batteries will be operational in April 2007.\n\nTime to go public? Maybe, he says. For a man, who took up a few insurance policies only because the agents were persistent, matters of personal finance do not rank rather high on his priority table. \"I would rather re-invest in business than purchase property, look up the stock market or mutual funds,\" he says. Perhaps a house in Gurgaon, a farmhouse, 21 offices, three factories and 1,000 employees, are enough for Sachdev to be unconcerned with personal finance."

    "content": "His journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience\n\nKunwer Sachdev, known as the ‘Inverter Man of India,’ made a significant impact on the country with his company, Su-Kam. Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev’s innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev’s reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev’s journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev’s legacy alive in the power backup industry."
