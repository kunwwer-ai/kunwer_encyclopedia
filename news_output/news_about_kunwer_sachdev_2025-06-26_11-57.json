    "content": "Kunwar Sachdev is the man who once sold pens door-to-door and worked as a marketer to fund his education before founding a company worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nSetting goals and achieving goals are two different things because winners and losers have the same goals, but most fail and few win. Kunwar Sachdev is one such example of achieving his goal. The saying \"one thought changes your entire life\" is often heard but rarely demonstrated. Kunwar Sachdev, for example, used to make a little money by selling pens door to door. One day, however, he had an idea and decided to invest some money to launch a successful business that is now operating not just in India but also in many other countries.\n\nGrowing up in the family of a railway clerk, Kunwer Sachdev is a dreamer who has become a great inspiration in India's power backup industry. His path, characterized by inventiveness and perseverance, demonstrates the transforming potential of commitment. Kunwar had raised the money for his education by going door-to-door to sell pens. He had given up on his dream of becoming a doctor since he could not get medical admission.\n\nWhile working in marketing for a cable company after graduating, Kunwar Sachdev learned that the industry has a lot of room to grow and that not all challenges must be overcome from the start. He just quit his job and founded Su-Kam Communication, which subsequently concentrated solely on producing solar-related products.\n\nThe company owned by Kunwar Sachdev manufactures a variety of solar products that are in high demand in India and abroad. Kunwar Sachdev reportedly owns businesses worth Rs 2300 crore."

His journey, marked by determination and innovation, shows the transformative power of dedication.\n\nIn 1984, fresh out of graduation, Kunwer started his journey with his brother's pen business. However, the power outages in the city became a huge problem, which needed a reliable power backup solution. Fueled by determination, he started Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer faced early setbacks, with initial inverters encountering issues. Undeterred, he revamped the technology, creating products that outshone competitors in both price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam, breaking new ground, became the first Indian power company to export its products globally, winning hearts in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa, and Nepal.\n\nThe visionary entrepreneur aimed for a 'Make in India' revolution, striving to make Su-Kam a global leader. Despite challenges, he took Su-Kam into the solar energy industry, capturing markets far and wide. However, a series of unfortunate events led Su-Kam into bankruptcy, leaving clients stranded without services.\n\nKunwar Sachdev currently owns a business valued at at arounf Rs 2300 crores, according to Economic Times.\n\nDuring that tough phase of his life, Kunwer's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up. Launching Su-vastika under Kunwer's mentorship, she rallied support from friends and distributors, resurrecting the brand.\n\nKunwer Sachdev's journey is a testament to the resilience of dreams. From the corridors of a small Delhi neighbourhood to global markets, he showed the spirit of turning challenges into opportunities.\n\nKunwer’s journey continues to illuminate the path for aspiring entrepreneurs, proving that with dedication and the right energy, dreams do indeed come true."

    "content": "His journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience\n\nKunwer Sachdev, known as the ‘Inverter Man of India,’ made a significant impact on the country with his company, Su-Kam. Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev’s innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev’s reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev’s journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev’s legacy alive in the power backup industry."
