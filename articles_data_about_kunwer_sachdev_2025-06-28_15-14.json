        "content": "Kunwer Sachdev\n\nMy journey as an entrepreneur has been anything but ordinary. I never set out to build a multi-million-dollar company, nor did I have a blueprint for success. What I had was an insatiable curiosity, an unyielding determination, and the belief that problems exist only to be solved. Even at the age of 15, I started selling pens to shopkeepers with my brother, which gave me my first experience of sales, a skill that proved invaluable throughout my career.https://kunwersachdev.com/mr-kunwer-sachdev-the-inverter-man-of-india-journey/\n\nI started my career in theCable TV business, learning the ropes of entrepreneurship through sheer experience. I had no formal education in technology or business, yet I was fascinated by how things worked‚Äîhow signals were transmitted, how machines functioned, how innovation could change lives. This curiosity became my biggest strength.\n\nIt was this same curiosity that led me to the world of power backup solutions. In the early days, people in India struggled withfrequent power cuts.Inverters and batteries were unreliable, inefficient, and often made with outdated technology. I saw a gap, an opportunity to create something better. With no background in electronics, I immersed myself in learning, experimenting, and innovating, and that‚Äôs howSu-Kam was born.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam was not easy. There were challenges at every step‚Äîfrom R&D and manufacturing to sales and service. But I believed in the power of perseverance and innovation. We introduced India‚Äôs first MOSFET-based inverter, India‚Äôs first DSP-based inverter, and many other groundbreaking technologies that changed the face of the industry.Su-Kam became more than just a company; it became a revolution. We not only built inverters, UPS systems, and solar solutions but also trained thousands of professionals, setting industry benchmarks.\n\nHowever, life has its twists and turns. Despite all the success, I had to step away from Su-Kam. But true passion never fades, and for me, innovation is not just about business‚Äîit is about making a difference. I knew my journey wasn‚Äôt over. That‚Äôs whenSu-vastika was born.\n\nWith Su-vastika, my vision is even larger. The world is moving towardssustainable energy, smart power backup solutions, and advanced energy storage systems. I am now focusing on creating patented technologies that will shape the future of power solutions‚Äîsolutions that are not just reliable and efficient but also environmentally friendly and future-ready.\n\nToday, Su-vastika is leading the way in Lithium Battery Energy Storage, Solar Energy Innovations, and Automatic Power Backup Systems. We are not just creating products; we are building an ecosystem of knowledge, innovation, and global impact.The AI is the new mantra for products, and we are building AI into each product to make them smart.\n\nOutside of work, I find inspiration and balance in my personal passions‚Äîswimming clears my mind, whistling lifts my spirit, trekking fuels my adventurous side,Yoga keeps me fit and reading keeps my mind sharpand ever-curious. These interests aren‚Äôt just hobbies; they‚Äôre a reflection of the same passion, discipline, and love for exploration that I bring into my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIf my journey has taught me anything, it is thatsuccess is not about what you achieve‚Äîit‚Äôs about the challenges you overcome, the knowledge you share, and the legacy you leave behind.Through Su-vastika, I want to continue pushing the boundaries of technology, inspiring the next generation of innovators, and proving that with determination, India can lead the world in power solutions.\n\nThe journey is far from over. In fact, it is only just beginning.\n\nThe future of DC systems in India The article discusses how Solar DC Systems could help solve India‚Äôs power crisis.\n\n‡§ú‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§π‡§£‡§§‡§æ‡§§! ‡§™‡•á‡§® ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•Ç‡§® ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§≠‡§æ‡§ó‡§µ‡§≤‡§æ, ‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•Ç‡§® ‡§â‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§ß‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§™‡§®‡•Ä Authored By‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï‡§æ ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ï | ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞\n\nSuccess Story: ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§∏‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•á‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§™‡•á‡§®, ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§á‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤, ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç 2300 ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡§º ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï\n\nThe story of Su-Kam and its founder, Kunwer Sachdev, is a notable one in the Indian business landscape, detailing both\n\nBeyond the Inverter: Unpacking the Entrepreneurial Journey of Su-Kam‚Äôs Founder We often see the finished product, the successful brand that\n\nKunwer Sachdev (born 16 November 1962) is an Indian entrepreneur who is the founder and Managing Director of Su-Kam.

        "content": "Kunwer Sachdev: The Visionary Entrepreneur Powering India's Future\n\nFrom the narrow lanes of Delhi to boardrooms across the globe, Kunwer Sachdev's journey is not just one of business success‚Äîit's a story of resilience, vision, and a relentless drive to solve real problems. Known as ‚ÄúThe Inverter Man of India‚Äù and now fondly called ‚ÄúThe Solar Man of India,‚Äù Kunwer is a man who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against him‚Äîand turned that dream into light for millions.\n\nA Spark Ignited Early\n\nKunwer Sachdev was born in a modest home in Delhi, where power cuts were a part of daily life. He wasn‚Äôt born into privilege, nor did he carry a degree from a fancy business school. What he had, however, was far more powerful‚Äîcuriosity, courage, and clarity of purpose. He could see what others overlooked: the quiet suffering of families left in the dark and businesses crippled by unreliable electricity.\n\nWhile others adapted to the darkness, Kunwer chose to challenge it.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam: Lighting Up Lives\n\nIn 1988, with more grit than capital, Kunwer founded Su-Kam Power Systems. He didn‚Äôt just want to build a company‚Äîhe wanted to solve a national problem. From inventing the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter to creating the iconic Home UPS, he turned Su-Kam into a beacon of innovation.\n\nUnder his leadership, Su-Kam wasn‚Äôt just a business‚Äîit was a movement. A movement that brought power, dignity, and stability to homes and villages across India. The company grew from a small setup to a global brand operating in over 90 countries, winning hearts and awards along the way.\n\nBut behind every product was a purpose. And behind every success, a sleepless night of hard work.\n\nA Story Worth Telling\n\nThe world took notice of this self-made man with a mission. Kunwer‚Äôs journey has been chronicled in some of India‚Äôs most inspiring books:\n\n- Booming Brands by Harsh Pamnani ‚Äì capturing how he built Su-Kam into a trusted name from scratch.- Making Breakthrough Innovations Happen by Porus Munshi ‚Äì highlighting his passion for solving India's energy crisis through bold, scalable ideas.- Connect the Dots by Rashmi Bansal ‚Äì showcasing Kunwer as the everyday hero who built an empire without an MBA, but with the school of life as his teacher.\n\nEach page is a tribute to his belief: Innovation is for everyone. Especially the ones who need it most.\n\nReinventing for Tomorrow: Su-vastika & Kunwwer.ai\n\nEven after building one of India‚Äôs most successful power brands, Kunwer didn‚Äôt stop. His heart still beats for the future‚Äîand for those who need it the most.\n\nWith Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., he‚Äôs now tackling the next frontier: energy storage. Through lithium-ion batteries and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), he‚Äôs helping India move towards a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAnd now, with Kunwwer.ai, he‚Äôs stepping into the world of artificial intelligence‚Äîyet again ahead of the curve. His vision: to democratize innovation, using AI to bring smart solutions to energy, education, and business.\n\nMore Than an Entrepreneur\n\nKunwer Sachdev is more than just a successful businessman. He is a mentor, a dreamer, a changemaker. He believes that true success lies not in wealth, but in impact‚Äîin the number of lives touched, the villages lit up, the hope restored.\n\nWords to Live By\n\n‚ÄúIf your innovation solves a real problem, success will chase you.

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience.

Learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 has appeared on advance\n                          Notice.\n\n3.       Briefly stated the petitioner, Mr. Kunwer Sachdev was married to\n                          respondent No. 2 Ms. Geeta Sachdev on 25.09.1987 according to Hindu rites\n                          and ceremonies at Arya Samaj Mandir, Mandir Marg, New Delhi. Two sons,\n                          Kanav and Shourya were born from their wedlock. However, due to ongoing\n                          disputes and quarrels, the parties have been living separately since\n                          September 2009 and have not been able to reconcile their differences.\n\n4.       The petitioner and respondent No. 2 jointly filed a Petition underSection 13(B)of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (\"HMA,1955\" hereinafter)\n                          before the Family Court, New Delhi. They entered into a Settlement and it\n                          was agreed that the Petitioner would pay a settlement amount of Rs.\n                          5,00,00,000/- and transfer complete rights, titles, and ownership of two\n                          immovable properties: one commercial property bearing No. WZ- 1402/1,\n                          Nangal Raya, Delhi-110046, and another residential property bearing No. F-\n                          37, Greenwood City, Gurgaon, Haryana in favour of Respondent No. 2.\n\n5.       The parties accepted the Settlement Deed dated 13.08.2015 in their\n                          respective statements and first motion of divorce underSection 13B(1)of\n                          the HMA, 1955 was allowed by the Order dated 14.08.2015.\n\n6.       In furtherance of the Settlement Deed, parties signed two addendum\n                          Agreements both dated 11.03.2016. The first Addendum Agreement was e-\n                          stamped at 6:46 PM and the second was e- stamped on 11.03.2016 at 6:48\n                          PM. There were thus, two Addendum Agreements signed on the same day e-\n                          stamped at a gap of two minutes.\n\n7. The second Addendum Agreement was presented before the Family Court\n                          in the second Petition for Divorce underSection 13(B)(2)of HMA wherein\n                          parties made their detailed statements endorsing the second Addendum\n                          Agreement and also deposed about the details of the Settlement. The\n                          statements were accepted and it was mentioned in the Order dated\n                          11.03.2016 that full and final settlement amount of Rs. 3 crores has been\n                          received by the respondent No. 2. The Divorce by Mutual Consent underSection 13(B)(2)of HMA, 1955 was accordingly given to the parties.\n\n8.    The petitioner has claimed that during the Divorce proceedings, he\n                          was unable to retrieve the cheques issued to respondent No. 2 in pursuance\n                          of the first Addendum. However, these cheques were wrongly deposited by\n                          her despite there being no underlying liability. In light of the final Second\n                          Addendum Agreement, she ought to have returned the cheques. But she has\n                          manipulated the facts to her advantage in order to coerce the petitioner and\n                          to extract more money.\n\n9. The respondent No. 2 filed a Complaint underSection 138of the\n                          Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the Petitioner for dishonour of\n                          above-mentioned       cheques   vide    Complaint     case    bearing        no.\n                          NACT/10395/2016 and NACT/10396/2016 which are pending adjudication\n                          before Hon‚Äüble Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram.\n\n10.

The   Petitioner   submitted      his\n                          representation to these publication houses requesting them for the removal\n                          of the Articles.\n\n12.   The petitioner has claimed that the present Complaint Case bearing\n                          No. 2086/2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 was yet\n                          another attempt by respondent No.2 to harass the petitioner. The respondent\n                          No. 2 by relying on the first Addendum read with the final Settlement, has\n                          sought to portray the petitioner has committed criminal breach of trust and\n                          cheating. She has concealed the second Addendum entered into between the\n                          parties. Moreover, he has impleaded Smt. Khushboo Sachdev, the second\n                          wife of the petitioner in the impugned F.I.R., even though she has no\n                          concern with any of this controversy.\n\n13.   The petitioner exhausted by the continuous harassment and hoping to\n                          achieve peace, the Petitioner paid the Respondent No. 2 Rs. 5,00,000/- on\n                          28.12.2022 and an additional Rs. 2,00,000/- on 21.02.2023, over and above\n                          the already paid settlement amount.\n\n14.   The petitioner has claimed that he has been dragged into false and\n                          frivolous litigation by respondent No. 2, who is a habitual litigant. The\n                          petitioner further submits that the IDBI Bank has filed a Petition for\n                          initiating personal insolvency of the Petitioner under Section 95 of the\n                          Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Consequently, an Interim\n                          Moratorium has commenced under Section 96 of the Code. Once an\n                          Application under Section 95 IBC is filed, no legal actions or proceedings\n                          can be initiated or continued against the personal Guarantor for any debt.\n\n15.   Owing to the interim moratorium in effect, the Respondent No. 2 was\n                          unable to pursue or continue any civil proceedings against the Petitioner,Signature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 4 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48including the said Civil Suit. The respondent No. 2 then resorted to the\n                          present vexatious Complaint, resulting in registration of the FIR. The\n                          petitioner has claimed that the entire Settlement amount in terms of the\n                          Settlement Deed stands paid to the Respondent No. 2. Any dispute\n                          specifically in regard to this Deed, is purely Civil in nature.\n\n16.   The petitioner has asserted that the allegations in the FIR include\n                          breach of trust, cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy, and criminal\n                          intimidation. It is alleged in the Complaint by respondent No.2 that the\n                          petitioner and his wife have committed multiple fraudulent activities and\n                          purportedly induced Respondent No. 2 to sign a settlement Agreement and\n                          addendum, promising a payment of Rs. 7 Crores. Allegedly, the Petitioner\n                          issued cheques that were dishonored due to insufficient funds, with no\n                          intention to honor the payment.\n\n17.   Further allegations are made in the Complaint that the petitioner and\n                          his wife intimidated and threatened respondent No.2 to prevent her from\n                          pursuing her legal action and coerced her into negotiating a reduction in the\n                          Settlement amount.\n\n18. It is stated in the Petition that the impugned FIR No.0126/2024 under\n                          Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 against him and his present wife\n                          had been registered in compliance of the Order dated 28.05.2024 of the\n                          learned MM in Complaint Case bearing no. 2086/2024 titled as ‚ÄûGeeta\n                          Sachdev vs State of Delhi' filed by the Respondent No. 2, ex-wife of the\n                          petitioner. It is asserted that this Order has been obtained by suppressing\n                          second and final Addendum dated 11.03.2016 bearing Certification No.\n                          INDL254474609476750 e-stamped on 10.03.2016 at 6:48 which was\n                          executed between the Petitioner and the Respondent No. 2.\n\n19. It is claimed that her actions are driven by a desire to disrupt the\n                          Petitioner‚Äüs current marital happiness and to harass them. It is a retaliatory\n                          move, aimed at causing distress and disarray in the Petitioner‚Äüs well-\n                          established and content life, rather than to address any legitimate legal\n                          grievance.\n\n20.   It is claimed that the allegations in the Complaint pertain solely to the\n                          terms of the Settlement between the petitioner and the respondent No. 2 and\n                          non performance of the second Addendum. On these allegations, no criminal\n                          offences are made out. Hence, the petitioner has sought the quashing of the\n                          FIR. The petitioner has placed reliance onIndian Oil Corporation v. NEPC\n                          India Limited and Others2006INSC 452, State of Haryana & Ors. Vs\n                          Bhajan Lal & Ors1992 AIR 604, Vishnu Kumar Shukla & Anr. vs the State\n                          of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.

Learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 has argued that two second\n                          Addendums were signed on 11.03.2016. The petitioner fraudulently without\n                          the respondent No. 2 being aware presented a second Addendum signed on\n                          11.03.2016 while she was under the impression of the first Addendum of the\n                          same date being the full and final Settlement.\n\n22.    She has further contended that the petitioner was regularly sending\n                          her WhatsApp messages and giving the assurance that the balance amount\n                          under the first Addendum Settlement shall be paid by him and he did make\n                          certain payments to the Respondent No. 2, who remained under a bona fide\n                          belief that the petitioner shall be honoring the said Addendum. The copies of\n                          the various WhatsApp conversations have also been tendered which areSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 6 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48taken on record.\n\n23. It is vehemently argued on behalf of the respondent No.2 that there is no\n                          ground for quashing of the FIR.\n\n24.   Submissions heard.\n\n25.   The petitioner and the respondent No. 2 are the divorced spouses who\n                          had multiple matrimonial litigations which finally culminated into Divorce\n                          by Mutual Consent vide Final Decree dated 11.03.2016. During their long\n                          acrimonious litigation, the parties entered into three Settlement Deeds; first\n                          being 13.08.2015, in which the petitioner had agreed to give her Rs. 5 crores\n                          and two immovable properties. This Settlement was presented at the time of\n                          First Divorce Petition and was accepted by the parties in their respective\n                          Statements before the Family Court and is not under dispute.\n\n26. The other two Agreements dated 11.03.2016, are:\n\n27.   It is not in dispute that the second Addendum dated 11.03.2016 which\n                          provided for payment of Rs. 3 crores and two properties, was presented in\n                          the Court at the time of recording of Statements of the parties under the\n                          Petition for Divorce underSection 13(B)2of Hindu Marriage Act (HMA).\n\n28.   The certified copy of the Judgement under Section (B) 2 HMA\n                          specifically records that the parties have amicably resolved all their disputes.\n                          The contents of the Second Addendum Settlement providing for totalSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                               Page 7 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48Settlement amount of Rs. 3 crores with two properties was specifically\n                          recorded. It is further mentioned that in terms of the second Addendum, the\n                          wife had already received Rs. 1.5 crore from the husband as was mentioned\n                          in the Petition and the statements made by the parties in the Court. Out of\n                          the remaining 1.5 crore, a sum of Rs. 1.25 crores has been deposited by way\n                          of Bank Draft bearing No. 501589 dated 10.03.2016, drawn on ICICI Bank\n                          in favor of Respondent No. 2. The balance 25 lakhs were to be paid to\n                          respondent No.2 herein at the time of quashing of FIR No. 147/2011 underSections 323/341/504IPC before the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur\n                          Bench. The respondent No. 2 undertook to cooperate and ensure her\n                          presence for the quashing of the FIR.\n\n29. The said Judgment further records that the parties had agreed that the\n                          petitioner/husband shall be the sole and absolute exclusive owner of\n                          residential Apartment bearing No. 1625 B Magnolias, Gold Course Road,\n                          Gurugram from the said date and that the Respondent No. 2/wife had\n                          already executed the necessary documents and Application for deletion of\n                          her name with regard to the said property. The parties undertook to\n                          cooperate with each other for implementation of the said Agreement.\n\n30.   Moreover, it was recorded that the exclusive and absolute title of\n                          commercial property bearing No. WZ-1401/2 Nangal Raya, Delhi - 110046\n                          shall also be with the petitioner. Both the parties undertook to abide by the\n                          terms and conditions of the Settlement as was mentioned in their Petition\n                          and the MOU/Addendum dated 11.03.2016 exhibited as Ex. P5. After\n                          recording the Settlement, the divorce by Mutual Consent underSection\n                          13(B)2HMA, was granted.\n\n31.   It is evident that the terms of this Settlement were specificallySignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                             Page 8 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48reproduced and the documents exhibited. In fact,         there was a specific\n                          reference that the total cash amount agreed was Rs. 3 crores out of which\n                          Rs. 1.5 crores already stood paid while Rs. 1.25 crores were deposited to be\n                          released to the respondent No. 2, only after execution of the requisite title\n                          documents. Having made specific statements and exhibiting the Agreement\n                          as Ex. P-5, the respondent No. 2 cannot now either deny or challenge the\n                          Judgement which has never been challenged by respondent No. 2 till date.\n                          The contents of this Settlement, which were endorsed and accepted by the\n                          Parties before the Court, was duly acted upon and the Divorce was granted.\n                          The contention of the respondent No. 2 that she has been cheated or\n                          defrauded or was not aware that the second Addendum stamped at 6:48 PM\n                          was not presented before the family court is behest of any logic especially\n                          when the Order granting the Divorce repeated and affirmed the contents of\n                          the Settlement in detail.\n\n32.   There being specific reproduction and re affirmation by the parties of\n                          the terms of the Agreement, it cannot be said that she was misled or the\n                          terms of the Settlement were misrepresented to her. Therefore, it has to be\n                          held that this second Addendum dated 11.03.2006 signed by the Parties at\n                          the same time, signatures on which are not denied by her, was a binding\n                          Settlement.\n\n33.    The next question which arises is the validity of the first Addendum\n                          e-stamped at 6:46 PM on 11.03.2016. 27.       Apparently, it seems that the\n                          parties arrived at two Addendum Settlements each of which were\n                          independent; one for the purpose of taking divorce by Mutual Consent while\n                          the other was for Settlement of other disputes, claims in respect of money\n                          and properties. In any case, it is a question of interpretation of the intentionSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                               Page 9 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48of the parties, which they are at liberty to establish in the appropriate Civil\n                          Litigation. There is nothing to show that the second Addendum had\n                          superseded the first Addendum. This is further corroborated by the fact that\n                          the respondent No. 2 never sought repudiation of this Agreement, which was\n                          the basis of divorce by mutual consent.\n\n34.    Apparently, the two Addendums signed on 11.03.2016 were intended\n                          to be independent of each other; while the second Addendum became the\n                          basis for Divorce by Mutual Consent, the grievance against first addendum\n                          has been raised only in 2024 by filing a Complaint for registration of FIR.\n\n35. Pertinently, this second Addendum which became the basis of divorce by\n                          Mutual Consent does not find any mention in the FIR, which is purely\n                          confined to the first Addendum.\n\n36. It is evident that the entire grievance of the respondent No. 2 is in regard\n                          to the non compliance of the First Addendum Settlement dated 11.03.2016.\n                          The parties have voluntarily entered into it and whatever be the implications,\n                          they are essentially civil in nature. Breach of a Settlement would entail only\n                          civil liabilities; the essential ingredient of dishonest or fraudulent intention\n                          which are the foundation for an offence of Cheating or Breach of Trust, are\n                          essentially missing in the present FIR. Significantly, while the Addendum\n                          Agreement is of 2016, the Criminal Complaint alleging fraud and breach of\n                          Trust vis. a viz. this Agreement, has been filed only in 2024 i.e. after eight\n                          years of its execution, leading to registration of impugned FIR.\n\n37.   Consequently, the FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 is hereby\n                          quashed along with all the proceedings emanating therefrom, leaving the\n                          parties to pursue their civil litigation and other litigation underSection 138NI Act, which have already been initiated.\n\n38.   It is hereby stated that observations made herein is for the purpose of\n                          the present petition and are not an expression on the merits of the Settlement\n                          Deeds.\n\n39.   The Petition along with other Application, if any is accordingly\n                          disposed of.\n\n(NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA)\n                                                                              JUDGE\n                          SEPTEMBER 17, 2024/PTSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 11 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48"

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev‚Äôs legacy alive in the power backup industry.\n\nSocial worker Ritu Narang wins 'Spirit of Yoga' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nVersha Verma, Lucknow-based judo player and poet, wins 'Humanitarian of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n13 soldiers killed, 6 children injured in suicide bombing in Pakistan, here's what we know so far\n\nPankaj Bhadouria wins Super Chef of the Year award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nPadma Shri Dr Soniya Nityanand wins 'Light of India' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nWarren Buffett takes big decision, donates Rs 51000 crore in Berkshire Shares to..., reason is...\n\nSuparna Sarkar wins Breaking Barriers award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nViral Video: Owner of Mahindra Scorpio parks car in an unusual place, internet jokes, 'Show¬†room¬†feeling'\n\nMLC 2025: Shimron Hetmyer does THIS against Kieron Pollard on last ball during Seattle Orcas vs MI New York match\n\nTrapped in Rs 499 EMIs: The silent financial crisis of India‚Äôs young generation\n\nShah Rukh Khan's KKR star batter to join Uttar Pradesh education department, Yogi govt to give him salary of Rs..., he is...\n\nSwati Kapoor, who provides 'Thaal Sewa' to over 1200 people daily, wins 'Social Worker of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n'Kashi Ki Didi' Ranjubala Singh wins 'Warrior Spirit' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nICAI to cap individual CA annual audits to 60, from..., president says, ‚ÄòCA can also carry out...‚Äô\n\nWho is Elizabeth MacDonough?

        "content": "Kunwer Sachdev, founder and managing director, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited, has helped catapult the company from a start-up to one of the fastest growing companies in the country in a short span of time. Born in a middle-class family in Delhi, Sachdev, with no technological background, founded a company that is today known for its technologically advanced products.\n\nSachdev has a degree in mathematical statistics and law from Delhi University. In 1998, he ventured into the power backup solutions business, sett-ing up Su-Kam. Today, the company has operations across 90 countries. Prior to this, he was involved in the cable television business. Under Sachdev‚Äôs leadership, Su-Kam has achieved several firsts to its credit. It has filed over 100 patents for technology and design in the power backup industry, the highest for any Indian company. It has also launched the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter, which has been declared as the Innovation of the Decade by India Today. ‚ÄúThese innovations were possible only due to the robust research and development unit of Su-Kam. Innovation and sophistication in products is my passion,‚Äù says Sachdev.\n\nHe sees scope for major growth in the solar power space. He has led the development of innovative solar solutions ‚Äì off-grid and on-grid systems ‚Äì¬† to cater to the needs of a range of consumers.\n\nOn the state of the power sector, Sachdev says, ‚ÄúElectricity is critical to power the economic growth of the country. India is on the road to development, but to accelerate growth, it is critical to ensure the availability of uninterrupted power supply. In today‚Äôs scenario, we lack the infrastructure to meet the growing demand for power.‚Äù He further underscores the importance of renewable energy to offset the demand for conventional fuels as well as to pave the way for cleaner solutions. ‚ÄúA green economy is the need of the hour,‚Äù he says.\n\nSachdev also has a flair for marketing, which has led him to launch several innovative branding initiatives for the company. Moreover, he sees internal branding as an important strategy to engage with employees. His peers see him as a leader, who has a novel approach towards solving tough problems. He is also an ardent sports enthusiast, with swimming and running being his favourites. Going forward, Sachdev aims to make Su-Kam a market leader in technology and innovation or ‚Äútechnovation‚Äù, as he calls it.\n\nSubscribeSeptember Issue\n\nCOPYRIGHT ¬© 2017-2022  | POWER LINE\n\nGET ACCESS TO OUR ARTICLESEnter your email addressSubscribe to NewsletterPlease leave this field empty.Œî\n\nGET ACCESS TO OUR ARTICLES\n\nEnter your email address\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nDownload Rate Card for Overseas Companies\n\nVerify Code (required)\n\nŒî\n\nDownload Rate Card for Indian Companies\n\nVerify Code (required)\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nŒî"

Two sons,\n                          Kanav and Shourya were born from their wedlock. However, due to ongoing\n                          disputes and quarrels, the parties have been living separately since\n                          September 2009 and have not been able to reconcile their differences.\n\n4.       The petitioner and respondent No. 2 jointly filed a Petition underSection 13(B)of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (\"HMA,1955\" hereinafter)\n                          before the Family Court, New Delhi. They entered into a Settlement and it\n                          was agreed that the Petitioner would pay a settlement amount of Rs.\n                          5,00,00,000/- and transfer complete rights, titles, and ownership of two\n                          immovable properties: one commercial property bearing No. WZ- 1402/1,\n                          Nangal Raya, Delhi-110046, and another residential property bearing No. F-\n                          37, Greenwood City, Gurgaon, Haryana in favour of Respondent No. 2.\n\n5.

The first Addendum Agreement was e-\n                          stamped at 6:46 PM and the second was e- stamped on 11.03.2016 at 6:48\n                          PM. There were thus, two Addendum Agreements signed on the same day e-\n                          stamped at a gap of two minutes.\n\n7. The second Addendum Agreement was presented before the Family Court\n                          in the second Petition for Divorce underSection 13(B)(2)of HMA wherein\n                          parties made their detailed statements endorsing the second Addendum\n                          Agreement and also deposed about the details of the Settlement.

The Divorce by Mutual Consent underSection 13(B)(2)of HMA, 1955 was accordingly given to the parties.\n\n8.    The petitioner has claimed that during the Divorce proceedings, he\n                          was unable to retrieve the cheques issued to respondent No. 2 in pursuance\n                          of the first Addendum. However, these cheques were wrongly deposited by\n                          her despite there being no underlying liability. In light of the final Second\n                          Addendum Agreement, she ought to have returned the cheques. But she has\n                          manipulated the facts to her advantage in order to coerce the petitioner and\n                          to extract more money.\n\n9. The respondent No. 2 filed a Complaint underSection 138of the\n                          Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the Petitioner for dishonour of\n                          above-mentioned       cheques   vide    Complaint     case    bearing        no.\n                          NACT/10395/2016 and NACT/10396/2016 which are pending adjudication\n                          before Hon‚Äüble Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram.\n\n10. The respondent No.2 has also filed a Civil Suit (Original Side) bearing\n                          No. 398/2019 underOrder XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\n                          seeking recovery of Rs. 4,05,00,000/- along with pendent lite and future\n                          interest @12% p.a..\n\n11.   Additionally, at the behest of Respondent No. 2, the distinguished\n                          Publication houses, Times of India and The Hindu, published defamatorySignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                             Page 3 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48Articles   concerning   the   Petitioner.   The   Petitioner   submitted      his\n                          representation to these publication houses requesting them for the removal\n                          of the Articles.\n\n12.   The petitioner has claimed that the present Complaint Case bearing\n                          No. 2086/2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 was yet\n                          another attempt by respondent No.2 to harass the petitioner. The respondent\n                          No. 2 by relying on the first Addendum read with the final Settlement, has\n                          sought to portray the petitioner has committed criminal breach of trust and\n                          cheating. She has concealed the second Addendum entered into between the\n                          parties. Moreover, he has impleaded Smt. Khushboo Sachdev, the second\n                          wife of the petitioner in the impugned F.I.R., even though she has no\n                          concern with any of this controversy.\n\n13.   The petitioner exhausted by the continuous harassment and hoping to\n                          achieve peace, the Petitioner paid the Respondent No. 2 Rs. 5,00,000/- on\n                          28.12.2022 and an additional Rs. 2,00,000/- on 21.02.2023, over and above\n                          the already paid settlement amount.\n\n14.   The petitioner has claimed that he has been dragged into false and\n                          frivolous litigation by respondent No. 2, who is a habitual litigant. The\n                          petitioner further submits that the IDBI Bank has filed a Petition for\n                          initiating personal insolvency of the Petitioner under Section 95 of the\n                          Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Consequently, an Interim\n                          Moratorium has commenced under Section 96 of the Code. Once an\n                          Application under Section 95 IBC is filed, no legal actions or proceedings\n                          can be initiated or continued against the personal Guarantor for any debt.\n\n15.   Owing to the interim moratorium in effect, the Respondent No. 2 was\n                          unable to pursue or continue any civil proceedings against the Petitioner,Signature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 4 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48including the said Civil Suit. The respondent No. 2 then resorted to the\n                          present vexatious Complaint, resulting in registration of the FIR. The\n                          petitioner has claimed that the entire Settlement amount in terms of the\n                          Settlement Deed stands paid to the Respondent No. 2. Any dispute\n                          specifically in regard to this Deed, is purely Civil in nature.\n\n16.   The petitioner has asserted that the allegations in the FIR include\n                          breach of trust, cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy, and criminal\n                          intimidation. It is alleged in the Complaint by respondent No.2 that the\n                          petitioner and his wife have committed multiple fraudulent activities and\n                          purportedly induced Respondent No. 2 to sign a settlement Agreement and\n                          addendum, promising a payment of Rs. 7 Crores. Allegedly, the Petitioner\n                          issued cheques that were dishonored due to insufficient funds, with no\n                          intention to honor the payment.\n\n17.   Further allegations are made in the Complaint that the petitioner and\n                          his wife intimidated and threatened respondent No.2 to prevent her from\n                          pursuing her legal action and coerced her into negotiating a reduction in the\n                          Settlement amount.\n\n18. It is stated in the Petition that the impugned FIR No.0126/2024 under\n                          Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 against him and his present wife\n                          had been registered in compliance of the Order dated 28.05.2024 of the\n                          learned MM in Complaint Case bearing no. 2086/2024 titled as ‚ÄûGeeta\n                          Sachdev vs State of Delhi' filed by the Respondent No. 2, ex-wife of the\n                          petitioner. It is asserted that this Order has been obtained by suppressing\n                          second and final Addendum dated 11.03.2016 bearing Certification No.\n                          INDL254474609476750 e-stamped on 10.03.2016 at 6:48 which was\n                          executed between the Petitioner and the Respondent No. 2.\n\n19. It is claimed that her actions are driven by a desire to disrupt the\n                          Petitioner‚Äüs current marital happiness and to harass them. It is a retaliatory\n                          move, aimed at causing distress and disarray in the Petitioner‚Äüs well-\n                          established and content life, rather than to address any legitimate legal\n                          grievance.\n\n20.   It is claimed that the allegations in the Complaint pertain solely to the\n                          terms of the Settlement between the petitioner and the respondent No. 2 and\n                          non performance of the second Addendum. On these allegations, no criminal\n                          offences are made out. Hence, the petitioner has sought the quashing of the\n                          FIR. The petitioner has placed reliance onIndian Oil Corporation v. NEPC\n                          India Limited and Others2006INSC 452, State of Haryana & Ors. Vs\n                          Bhajan Lal & Ors1992 AIR 604, Vishnu Kumar Shukla & Anr. vs the State\n                          of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.

Learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 has argued that two second\n                          Addendums were signed on 11.03.2016. The petitioner fraudulently without\n                          the respondent No. 2 being aware presented a second Addendum signed on\n                          11.03.2016 while she was under the impression of the first Addendum of the\n                          same date being the full and final Settlement.\n\n22.    She has further contended that the petitioner was regularly sending\n                          her WhatsApp messages and giving the assurance that the balance amount\n                          under the first Addendum Settlement shall be paid by him and he did make\n                          certain payments to the Respondent No. 2, who remained under a bona fide\n                          belief that the petitioner shall be honoring the said Addendum. The copies of\n                          the various WhatsApp conversations have also been tendered which areSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 6 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48taken on record.\n\n23. It is vehemently argued on behalf of the respondent No.2 that there is no\n                          ground for quashing of the FIR.\n\n24.   Submissions heard.\n\n25.   The petitioner and the respondent No. 2 are the divorced spouses who\n                          had multiple matrimonial litigations which finally culminated into Divorce\n                          by Mutual Consent vide Final Decree dated 11.03.2016. During their long\n                          acrimonious litigation, the parties entered into three Settlement Deeds; first\n                          being 13.08.2015, in which the petitioner had agreed to give her Rs. 5 crores\n                          and two immovable properties. This Settlement was presented at the time of\n                          First Divorce Petition and was accepted by the parties in their respective\n                          Statements before the Family Court and is not under dispute.\n\n26. The other two Agreements dated 11.03.2016, are:\n\n27.   It is not in dispute that the second Addendum dated 11.03.2016 which\n                          provided for payment of Rs. 3 crores and two properties, was presented in\n                          the Court at the time of recording of Statements of the parties under the\n                          Petition for Divorce underSection 13(B)2of Hindu Marriage Act (HMA).\n\n28.   The certified copy of the Judgement under Section (B) 2 HMA\n                          specifically records that the parties have amicably resolved all their disputes.\n                          The contents of the Second Addendum Settlement providing for totalSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                               Page 7 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48Settlement amount of Rs. 3 crores with two properties was specifically\n                          recorded. It is further mentioned that in terms of the second Addendum, the\n                          wife had already received Rs. 1.5 crore from the husband as was mentioned\n                          in the Petition and the statements made by the parties in the Court. Out of\n                          the remaining 1.5 crore, a sum of Rs. 1.25 crores has been deposited by way\n                          of Bank Draft bearing No. 501589 dated 10.03.2016, drawn on ICICI Bank\n                          in favor of Respondent No. 2. The balance 25 lakhs were to be paid to\n                          respondent No.2 herein at the time of quashing of FIR No. 147/2011 underSections 323/341/504IPC before the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur\n                          Bench. The respondent No. 2 undertook to cooperate and ensure her\n                          presence for the quashing of the FIR.\n\n29. The said Judgment further records that the parties had agreed that the\n                          petitioner/husband shall be the sole and absolute exclusive owner of\n                          residential Apartment bearing No. 1625 B Magnolias, Gold Course Road,\n                          Gurugram from the said date and that the Respondent No. 2/wife had\n                          already executed the necessary documents and Application for deletion of\n                          her name with regard to the said property. The parties undertook to\n                          cooperate with each other for implementation of the said Agreement.\n\n30.   Moreover, it was recorded that the exclusive and absolute title of\n                          commercial property bearing No. WZ-1401/2 Nangal Raya, Delhi - 110046\n                          shall also be with the petitioner. Both the parties undertook to abide by the\n                          terms and conditions of the Settlement as was mentioned in their Petition\n                          and the MOU/Addendum dated 11.03.2016 exhibited as Ex. P5. After\n                          recording the Settlement, the divorce by Mutual Consent underSection\n                          13(B)2HMA, was granted.\n\n31.   It is evident that the terms of this Settlement were specificallySignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                             Page 8 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48reproduced and the documents exhibited. In fact,         there was a specific\n                          reference that the total cash amount agreed was Rs. 3 crores out of which\n                          Rs. 1.5 crores already stood paid while Rs. 1.25 crores were deposited to be\n                          released to the respondent No. 2, only after execution of the requisite title\n                          documents. Having made specific statements and exhibiting the Agreement\n                          as Ex. P-5, the respondent No. 2 cannot now either deny or challenge the\n                          Judgement which has never been challenged by respondent No. 2 till date.\n                          The contents of this Settlement, which were endorsed and accepted by the\n                          Parties before the Court, was duly acted upon and the Divorce was granted.\n                          The contention of the respondent No. 2 that she has been cheated or\n                          defrauded or was not aware that the second Addendum stamped at 6:48 PM\n                          was not presented before the family court is behest of any logic especially\n                          when the Order granting the Divorce repeated and affirmed the contents of\n                          the Settlement in detail.\n\n32.   There being specific reproduction and re affirmation by the parties of\n                          the terms of the Agreement, it cannot be said that she was misled or the\n                          terms of the Settlement were misrepresented to her. Therefore, it has to be\n                          held that this second Addendum dated 11.03.2006 signed by the Parties at\n                          the same time, signatures on which are not denied by her, was a binding\n                          Settlement.\n\n33.    The next question which arises is the validity of the first Addendum\n                          e-stamped at 6:46 PM on 11.03.2016. 27.       Apparently, it seems that the\n                          parties arrived at two Addendum Settlements each of which were\n                          independent; one for the purpose of taking divorce by Mutual Consent while\n                          the other was for Settlement of other disputes, claims in respect of money\n                          and properties. In any case, it is a question of interpretation of the intentionSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                               Page 9 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48of the parties, which they are at liberty to establish in the appropriate Civil\n                          Litigation. There is nothing to show that the second Addendum had\n                          superseded the first Addendum. This is further corroborated by the fact that\n                          the respondent No. 2 never sought repudiation of this Agreement, which was\n                          the basis of divorce by mutual consent.\n\n34.    Apparently, the two Addendums signed on 11.03.2016 were intended\n                          to be independent of each other; while the second Addendum became the\n                          basis for Divorce by Mutual Consent, the grievance against first addendum\n                          has been raised only in 2024 by filing a Complaint for registration of FIR.\n\n35. Pertinently, this second Addendum which became the basis of divorce by\n                          Mutual Consent does not find any mention in the FIR, which is purely\n                          confined to the first Addendum.\n\n36. It is evident that the entire grievance of the respondent No. 2 is in regard\n                          to the non compliance of the First Addendum Settlement dated 11.03.2016.\n                          The parties have voluntarily entered into it and whatever be the implications,\n                          they are essentially civil in nature. Breach of a Settlement would entail only\n                          civil liabilities; the essential ingredient of dishonest or fraudulent intention\n                          which are the foundation for an offence of Cheating or Breach of Trust, are\n                          essentially missing in the present FIR.

        "content": "Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev built his company's fortune by cashing in on an unreliable power grid. Now, he's looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit\n\nWhen he turned 15, Kunwer Sachdev began helping his older brother sell pens to shops in Delhi. It was the late 1970s, and the nation‚Äôs capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India‚Äôs largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices‚Äîwhich he didn‚Äôt have access to when he was growing up‚Äîthat provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.Power outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world‚Äôs population, don‚Äôt have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.These days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs promise of replicating Gujarat‚Äôs 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It‚Äôs also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit.Su-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.‚ÄúWe started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don‚Äôt have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I‚Äôm already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,‚Äù says Sachdev.He may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. ‚ÄúWe started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,‚Äù he says.Su-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.Su-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.At the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚ÄùA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines.Subscribe Now(This story appears in the 12 December, 2014 issue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Forbes India.

And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.\n\nBitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.At the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚ÄùA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines.Subscribe Now(This story appears in the 12 December, 2014 issue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Forbes India.

        "content": "Founder & CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems\n\nFebruary 11, 2015 6:12 am/2 Commentson ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù to reduce India‚Äôs electronics import¬†bill\n\nMake in Indiais the biggest initiative launched by our Prime Minister to attract investors to our country and to encourage them to manufacture in India. This one campaign will provide the much needed boost to India‚Äôs economy by creating jobs, making India a self reliant economy and getting the country its rightful place under the sun. The Prime Minister has also set very high targets for the focus sectors.\n\nMrKunwer Sachdeva, Managing Director Su-Kam Power Systems, while speaking to a team fromIndia Infoline(IIFL) lauded the Prime Minister‚Äôs initiative, especially in the Solar Sector. Under the National Solar Mission, the Prime Minister has enhanced the goal from 20 GW of solar energy by 2020 to 100 GW, a huge step. Mr Sachdev believes that this target though achievable would require a slew of investors, manufacturers, and other involvement of many stakeholders.\n\nThe Inverter Man of India is very upbeat about India‚Äôs performance based on the steps taken byNarendra Modi. A number of new technologies are being developed in India. Su-Kam well symbolises Make in India ‚Äì for over 15 years now the company has been innovating and manufacturing in India. The company holds close to 100 design patents in India, USA and other countries, and over 100 technology patents. Today the company files a minimum of 30 patents a year. However, Mr Sachdeva believes that the Patent granting system in the country leaves a lot to be desired. The patents that Su-Kam has filed for over six years ago are yet to be granted. In today‚Äôs dynamic world technology changes very fast and some of these have already become obsolete.\n\nThis needs to be fixed very quickly. Having said that there is no doubt that the Make in India initiative will ensure that a large number of companies start manufacturing in India, thus generating employment and improving the standard of living in the country.\n\nMr Sachdeva also believes that this initiative can have a major impact at India‚Äôs macro-economic picture. For instance, if we were to only focus on the electronics industry, there is much that can be achieved. According to industry experts, India‚Äôs electronic imports may surpass its oil import bill by 2030. Keeping the current oil prices in view, this aim may also be achieved by 2025. Currently the annual imports stand at over USD 35 billion!\n\nFirm laws and a fast paced administrative machinery are critical to the success of the Make in India campaign, said Mr Kunwer Sachdev while speaking to the IIFL team.\n\nJanuary 12, 2015 6:00 am/16 Commentson Inverter Man of India ‚Äì Always a Step¬†Ahead!\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev has been aptly given the title of the ‚ÄúInverter Man of India‚Äù. Frustrated over a malfunctioning inverter at his house he opened the inverter and studied the reasons for its continuous failure. Little did he know then that he was taking the first step toward revolutionising an industry that was highly unorganised.\n\nWhen he opened that inverter,Kunwer Sachdevaalso did not realise that with that one action he was about to script his life‚Äôs story of rags to riches. Mr Sachdev hails from a very humble background and spent his early career selling pens. He faced numerous challenges at every step, however he never deterred, building his company from strength to strength. He always searched for an opportunity when faced with a problem, rather than giving up he tried to find a solution and move ahead.\n\nThoughKunwer Sachdevhad no formal training in electronics or an engineering degree, he built a power backup solutions company known globally for products backed by world class technology. Mr Sachdeva‚Äôs vision, entrepreneurial capability and determination led him to build Su-Kam into a Superbrand.\n\nAn innovation driven company, Su-Kam is always a step ahead of the industry.Kunwer Sachdeva, who built Su-Kam into a Rs 1000 crore plus company realised early on that Solar is the answer to India‚Äôs growing power needs. Su-Kam has a very strong R&D which is constantly working on developing innovative solar solutions. That day is perhaps not far when the Inverter Man of India will get renamed as the Solar Man of India.\n\nNovember 28, 2014 11:08 am/27 Commentson The Inverter Man of India runs the Airtel Half¬†Marathon\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev, also known as the Inverter Man of India, ran the Airtel Half Marathon on November 23, 2014 in Delhi. Achieving a time of 2hrs 21 mins, he ran 21 kms. Mr Sachdev is an avid sports person and a swimmer. He found the time to run the marathon despite his busy schedule, as he was determined to do so this year.Mr Kunwer Sachdeva believes in the saying ‚Äú‚ÄùFinishing a marathon is a state of mind that says ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE‚Äù. Running the marathon has been just that for him ‚Äì breaking a mental barrier that it is difficult to run 21 kms at a stretch.\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdeva has lived his life by the saying ‚ÄúAnything is Possible‚Äù ‚Äì overcoming challenges and proving it right over and over again. Coming from a very humble background, Mr Kunwer Sachdeva has built a Rs. 1200 crore company. Though academically he is not a technical person, he is credited with transforming the inverter industry from a non-technical industry into a highly technologically advanced industry!\n\nEven after running the half marathon, Mr Sachdeva‚Äôs batteries were as charged as those manufactured by his company. Ask him where he gets this energy from, and he says it is his determination and grit to achieve the impossible and break barriers that drive him. This is why he emerges victorious over and over again.\n\nJune 9, 2014 7:01 am/Leave a comment\n\nIndiaMART & ET NOW joined hands to present ‚ÄòIndiaMART Leaders of Tomorrow Awards‚Äô to recognise the contribution of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in driving India‚Äôs march to global stardom.

        "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention. It mostly consists of the \"Bharat Shiromani\" award given by the Indian government and the Ernst & Young \"Best Industrialist of the Year\" honor. ¬†Kunwar Sachdev's biography, it is clear that talent alone may make a person successful without needing a degree as you know that despite being successful, Bill Gates and Facebook are former students of Mark Zuckerberg College.\n\nRead More News :\n\nStepping out of the Domestic Threshold, becoming the Richest Mother\n\nIndia's retail king, Radhakishan Damani\n\n¬© 2025 siliconindia.com All rights reserved.Attorneys Near Me|Attorneys"

Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.Kunwer Sachdev: Rags To RichesA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi.

Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients.

Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets.

Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes.

Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did.

Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did. And he is not done yet.\n\nHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family.

Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India. The company is one of the most rapidly growing and progressive businesses in the country. Sachdev has been an inspiration to many who have proven that dreams do come true if we put in our dedication and hard work with the right energy.\n\nKunwer Sachdev was raised in the family of a railway clerk in Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh neighbourhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, he started working in his brother‚Äôs pen business. Due to continuous power outrage, he quickly understood that there was a huge potential in the field of power backup. With the challenges of a severe power deficit, he decided to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer had a difficult time bringing investment for his business but it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to some issues. He then improved them and made them better than the ones available in the market. After much research, he approached dealers and wholesalers. Even though the market was already crowded with various brands Su-kam‚Äôs inverters were unmatched in terms of price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam became the first company in the power industry which initiated exporting its products to the international markets.\n\nHe envisioned a Make in India campaign and his company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. He has also captured the markets in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa and Nepal where his products were valued for their quality and reliability.\n\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n\nKunwer expanded Su-Kam and made the brand widely known for its proficiency in the solar energy industry.

        "content": "BUSINESS\n\nKunwar Sachdev is the man who once sold pens door-to-door and worked as a marketer to fund his education before founding a company worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nRitik Raj\n\nUpdated :Feb 08, 2024, 10:09 AM IST| Edited by :Ritik Raj\n\nSetting goals and achieving goals are two different things because winners and losers have the same goals, but most fail and few win. Kunwar Sachdev is one such example of achieving his goal. The saying \"one thought changes your entire life\" is often heard but rarely demonstrated. Kunwar Sachdev, for example, used to make a little money by selling pens door to door. One day, however, he had an idea and decided to invest some money to launch a successful business that is now operating not just in India but also in many other countries.\n\nGrowing up in the family of a railway clerk, Kunwer Sachdev is a dreamer who has become a great inspiration in India's power backup industry. His path, characterized by inventiveness and perseverance, demonstrates the transforming potential of commitment. Kunwar had raised the money for his education by going door-to-door to sell pens.
