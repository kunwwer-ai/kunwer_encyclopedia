    "description": "How many of you would care to look twice at the guy who came to fix the cable for your new TV or even thought he would have a great career ? And that‚Äôs why, no one could believe but one such man could emerge as a game changer of entire industry, a pioneer who would set new benchmarks for the sector, an entrepreneur who would generate Rs. 1000-crore annual turnover from virtually nothing, AND with no formal education in management or technical expertise. Who are we talking about?\n\nMeet Kunwer Sachdev, the man of inspiration, and the man behind Su-Kam inverters!\n\nHe is the man who lit up millions of homes in the country during the incessant power shortages and went on to become one of the biggest inverter manufacturers in India after he launched his company Su-Kam in 1998. For all you budding entrepreneurs, here‚Äôs his story.\n\nHailing from a humble middle-class Punjabi family in Delhi, Kunwer‚Äôs childhood was spent in a small home with his parents and two brothers. His father was a clerk in Indian Railways and mother was a housewife. He completed his primary education at a private school but later shifted to a government school due to lack of resources.\n\n‚ÄúFrom a graduate in statistics to a business technologist is surely an unusual leap, but business was always on my mind. I thought of nothing else while I was in college,‚Äù confesses Sachdev.\n\nFailure has been the cornerstone of every success is what Sachdev believed.\n\nHe first tried to join his brother in the business of selling pens but they soon fell out.  His next career move as a sales executive in a cable company was equally short-lived.",
