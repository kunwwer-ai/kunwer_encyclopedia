I was not hopping this event to be successful, the way it comes out to be as this is a Govt organized show all the decision makers are coming and we are very happy to participate in this show. Such shows are good platform for the people to came and explore whatâ€™s coming up. As we have the technology and showing the technology at times is very tough, so we bought and put us things here to showcase the market.
We are already a part of solar industry and biggest rooftop solar setup installer in India. As far as people interest is concerned we lack people to connect to the audients. For my each advertisement I got 500 queries that illustrate the awareness in market. Taking about prospects, first I would like to comment on present status of solar based installations. Most of the installations are either not working or lack proper service, as the people lack in-depth knowledge of the technology and standards resulting is misuse of money, time & resources. We a technology based company provides right solution for the appropriate job & application.
In my opinion it is not about people, it is about companies. In India we donâ€™t have sufficient companies who can about available solutions and benefits, as this is a coming up industry and we lack technocrat man-power. Su-kam feels that, lots of peoples are required how can go to market and tell them how to go for solar and benefits they will be getting and so we are hiring and training peoples.
Cost optimizations have already been done. Generally power is 7.00 Rs per unit for commercial purposes that could be easily covered with a solar system guaranteed. We are analyzing the returns provided by solar based installations, and it comes out in 10 years a solar based system given returns a bit more than investment in property. I think 3-5 years will be a max time span for India to mature solar system resources, systems and man-power.
Su-kam is presently focused on commercial set-ups, I am offering grid connected set-ups to people on very attractive prices and my strategy is to let themselves analysis the benefits. For example, say a people is having a load of 10KW; I installed a project of 1KW on the grid. Customers already have a generator, the unit cost is 8.00 INR and generator cost is 20.00 INR. The customer will sees the benefits in their bills and understand what we offer them rather than theoretical lectures. Further we are working with state-govt projects.
