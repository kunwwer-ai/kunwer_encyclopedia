Mr. Kunwer Sachdev founded Su-vastika after the bankruptcy of Su-kamMr. Kunwwer Sachdev is indeed the founder of Su-Kam, a well-known Indian company specializing in power backup solutions, inverters, and solar products. However, after leaving Su-Kam, he created Su-vastika. He founded a new company called Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., which focuses on innovative energy solutions, including lithium-ion batteries and advanced power electronics. Su-vastika is a separate entity and not the new name for Su-Kam.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunwer_SachdevThe focus of Mr. kunwwer Sachdev is to develop new technologies in the battery Energy Storage Systems which is the focus area of govt of India as the solar energy need to be stored for the peak power and emergency needs.https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2019-10/ISGF-Report-on-Energy-Storage-System-%28ESS%29-Roadmap-for-India-2019-2032.pdf
