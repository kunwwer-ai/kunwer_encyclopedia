Kunwer Sachdev: The Visionary Entrepreneur Powering India's Future
From the narrow lanes of Delhi to boardrooms across the globe, Kunwer Sachdev's journey is not just one of business success—it's a story of resilience, vision, and a relentless drive to solve real problems. Known as “The Inverter Man of India” and now fondly called “The Solar Man of India,” Kunwer is a man who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against him—and turned that dream into light for millions.
A Spark Ignited Early
Kunwer Sachdev was born in a modest home in Delhi, where power cuts were a part of daily life. He wasn’t born into privilege, nor did he carry a degree from a fancy business school. What he had, however, was far more powerful—curiosity, courage, and clarity of purpose. He could see what others overlooked: the quiet suffering of families left in the dark and businesses crippled by unreliable electricity.
While others adapted to the darkness, Kunwer chose to challenge it.
Building Su-Kam: Lighting Up Lives
In 1988, with more grit than capital, Kunwer founded Su-Kam Power Systems. He didn’t just want to build a company—he wanted to solve a national problem. From inventing the world’s first plastic-body inverter to creating the iconic Home UPS, he turned Su-Kam into a beacon of innovation.
Under his leadership, Su-Kam wasn’t just a business—it was a movement. A movement that brought power, dignity, and stability to homes and villages across India. The company grew from a small setup to a global brand operating in over 90 countries, winning hearts and awards along the way.
But behind every product was a purpose. And behind every success, a sleepless night of hard work.
A Story Worth Telling
The world took notice of this self-made man with a mission. Kunwer’s journey has been chronicled in some of India’s most inspiring books:
- Booming Brands by Harsh Pamnani – capturing how he built Su-Kam into a trusted name from scratch.- Making Breakthrough Innovations Happen by Porus Munshi – highlighting his passion for solving India's energy crisis through bold, scalable ideas.- Connect the Dots by Rashmi Bansal – showcasing Kunwer as the everyday hero who built an empire without an MBA, but with the school of life as his teacher.
Each page is a tribute to his belief: Innovation is for everyone. Especially the ones who need it most.
Reinventing for Tomorrow: Su-vastika & Kunwwer.ai
Even after building one of India’s most successful power brands, Kunwer didn’t stop. His heart still beats for the future—and for those who need it the most.
With Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., he’s now tackling the next frontier: energy storage. Through lithium-ion batteries and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), he’s helping India move towards a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.
And now, with Kunwwer.ai, he’s stepping into the world of artificial intelligence—yet again ahead of the curve. His vision: to democratize innovation, using AI to bring smart solutions to energy, education, and business.
More Than an Entrepreneur
Kunwer Sachdev is more than just a successful businessman. He is a mentor, a dreamer, a changemaker. He believes that true success lies not in wealth, but in impact—in the number of lives touched, the villages lit up, the hope restored.
Words to Live By
“If your innovation solves a real problem, success will chase you. Not the other way around.”— Kunwer Sachdev
