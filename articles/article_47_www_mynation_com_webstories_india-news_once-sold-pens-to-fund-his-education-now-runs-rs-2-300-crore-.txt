Kunwer Sachdev is known as the 'Inverter Man of India', founder and former CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems. His journey of carving success through humble beginnings is inspiring.
Kunwer was born to a railway clerk father in Punjab Bagh, Delhi. He used to sell pens on the street for his brother's pen business. That's how he funded his education.
After graduation, Kunwer wanted to become a doctor and study medical, however due to financial setbacks he had to drop his dream and sell pens to make a small income.
Severe power outages in the city inspired Kunwer to establish Su-Kam in 1998. Initially, he faced challenges, however, he innovated and built better price and quality inverters.
Su-Kam became India's first and largest power company to sell internationally to markets like the Middle East, Bangladesh, and Nepal. It made it a global name.
Kunwer revolutionized 'Make in India' and also ventured into solar power. The company expanded its business, however some bad decisions led to its bankruptcy and clients leaving.
Su-Kam was revived by Kunwer's wife,Â Khushboo Sachdev, who founded Su-Vastika and gained support from clients and friends. Now Su-Kam has a market value of Rs 2,300 crore.
