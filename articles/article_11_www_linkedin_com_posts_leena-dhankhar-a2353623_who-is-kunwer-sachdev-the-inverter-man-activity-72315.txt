From Dorm Room Dreams to 4 Billion $ Full Stack Financial Entity : A startup story less known!

In the journals of entrepreneurial history, there are tales that go beyond mere cases of success; they become legends, directing lights for aspiring pioneers. One such tale is the history of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which is proof of the strength of fellowship, perseverance, and carefully iterated business models.

In the quiet hallways of a hostel in 1987, two young chartered accountants, Motilal Oswal and Raamdeo Agarwal formed a friendship. United by a shared interest and love for business, their modest hostel room became the birthplace of innovation.

Oswal's entrepreneurial spirit and Agarwal's love of research served as the driving powers behind the development of their equity-centric business idea. While Oswal would do stock market trading, Agarwal would do the research and analysis. Interestingly, with limited means at the start, Agarwal would buy just 1 share of a company so that he could get access to the company annual reports that he would gorge on to learn more about the company. Their business model was simple, clean and clear -  “Knowledge First” and then “Invest”. 

Their dream became a reality in 1996 with the founding of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd., a significant turning point in their entrepreneurial career. The growth levers were well identified : foray into diverse financial domains in the subsequent years, such as - Stock broking, Mutual Funds, Wealth Management, Asset Management, Private Equity, Loans and a few more - earn revenue from these services - reinvest the earnings back into the equity market from their own Treasury books. It is powerful double engine growth that has helped MOFSL emerge into a 4 BN $ full stack financial services entity.

Interestingly, MOFSL has clocked around 2000 Cr profits in the first 9 months of this FY , a staggering growth of over 200% than the same period last year. 

We all believe that the startup culture emerged in the West. Oblivious to most, stories such as MOFSL actually started nearly 4 decades ago in our own country. There are many more such successful startup stories which are homegrown and have emerged into very successful enterprises over time. Their narrative serves as a reminder of the innovative spirit that molded India's homegrown startup culture in addition to being a tale of success. It's time we looked into our own success stories of ‘Startups’ and ‘Entrepreneurship’ to take inspiration.

Watch our webinar with Mr. Shalibhadra Shah, CFO of MOFSL, to know more about the company's inspirational story.https://lnkd.in/diYCbeMsFind out more about MOFSL current NCD IPO, offering attractive coupon rates upto to 9.70%, closing  on May 7th, 2024, and take benefit of the chance to invest in this Financial behemoth :https://lnkd.in/dM-akas8

TVS Capital Funds(TCF), set up in 2007 byGopal Srinivasan, has carried forward the entrepreneurial legacy of the iconic TVS Group for nearly two decades. A third-generation entrepreneur from that prominent business family and chairman of TVS Electronics, Gopal, too, had a unique but clear vision when he explored the PE space. Backed by TVS and Shriram Groups, he went on to launch India’s largest rupee-only capital fund to “empower next-generation entrepreneurs building multi-decadal businesses”👇

As Gopal mentioned in an earlier interview with Inc42, one found little regulatory control when TCF entered private investments. But despite the risks of turmoil in an under-regulated market at the time, institutional and individual investors had a strong interest in funding innovative, forward-thinking businesses.

Since its launch in 2007, TCF has deployed nearly INR 3,000 Cr from three growth focussed PE funds, fully exited its first two funds and deployed 96% of its third fund.

In January 2024, TCF got SEBI’s approval to launch its fourth fund and has raised INR 2,500 Cr out of the total corpus of INR 3000 Cr, with a focus on financial services and technology.

The legacy PE firm is now undergoing a technology transformation to reach the next level in terms of investment efficiency and operational excellence.

CTOL Digital Solutions: Pioneering Swiss Intelligence and Digital Tech Services  (I’m sorry I can’t respond to all messages right now as we’re focused on our main projects. Thank you so much for understanding!)
HungryPanda's recent $55 million Series D+ funding announcement has ignited a fierce debate within the food delivery industry. While the company touts this as a success, the reality is far more complicated. Most of this cash isn't equity—it’s debt, raising alarm bells about its financial health and long-term strategy.

Critics are voicing concerns over internal mismanagement and allegations of driver exploitation, highlighting a troubling trend of companies prioritizing growth over ethics. As market saturation and changing consumer behaviors squelch profit margins, can HungryPanda navigate these choppy waters without sacrificing its reputation?

In today's competitive landscape, transparency and trust are paramount. Companies like HungryPanda must shift focus towards sustainable practices and genuine partnerships if they hope to survive and thrive. The question remains: can they adapt fast enough in a fast-evolving market? As industry watchers, we need to remain vigilant.
