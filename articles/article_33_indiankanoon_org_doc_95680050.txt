                          Kanav and Shourya were born from their wedlock. However, due to ongoing
                          disputes and quarrels, the parties have been living separately since
                          September 2009 and have not been able to reconcile their differences.
4.       The petitioner and respondent No. 2 jointly filed a Petition underSection 13(B)of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 ("HMA,1955" hereinafter)
                          before the Family Court, New Delhi. They entered into a Settlement and it
                          was agreed that the Petitioner would pay a settlement amount of Rs.
                          5,00,00,000/- and transfer complete rights, titles, and ownership of two
                          immovable properties: one commercial property bearing No. WZ- 1402/1,

                          37, Greenwood City, Gurgaon, Haryana in favour of Respondent No. 2.

                          respective statements and first motion of divorce underSection 13B(1)of
                          the HMA, 1955 was allowed by the Order dated 14.08.2015.
6.       In furtherance of the Settlement Deed, parties signed two addendum
                          Agreements both dated 11.03.2016. The first Addendum Agreement was e-
                          stamped at 6:46 PM and the second was e- stamped on 11.03.2016 at 6:48
                          PM. There were thus, two Addendum Agreements signed on the same day e-
                          stamped at a gap of two minutes.
7. The second Addendum Agreement was presented before the Family Court
                          in the second Petition for Divorce underSection 13(B)(2)of HMA wherein
                          parties made their detailed statements endorsing the second Addendum
                          Agreement and also deposed about the details of the Settlement. The
                          statements were accepted and it was mentioned in the Order dated
                          11.03.2016 that full and final settlement amount of Rs. 3 crores has been
                          received by the respondent No. 2. The Divorce by Mutual Consent underSection 13(B)(2)of HMA, 1955 was accordingly given to the parties.
8.    The petitioner has claimed that during the Divorce proceedings, he
                          was unable to retrieve the cheques issued to respondent No. 2 in pursuance
                          of the first Addendum. However, these cheques were wrongly deposited by
                          her despite there being no underlying liability. In light of the final Second
                          Addendum Agreement, she ought to have returned the cheques. But she has
                          manipulated the facts to her advantage in order to coerce the petitioner and
                          to extract more money.
9. The respondent No. 2 filed a Complaint underSection 138of the
                          Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the Petitioner for dishonour of
                          above-mentioned       cheques   vide    Complaint     case    bearing        no.
                          NACT/10395/2016 and NACT/10396/2016 which are pending adjudication
                          before Honâ€Ÿble Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram.
10. The respondent No.2 has also filed a Civil Suit (Original Side) bearing
                          No. 398/2019 underOrder XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
                          seeking recovery of Rs. 4,05,00,000/- along with pendent lite and future
                          interest @12% p.a..
11.   Additionally, at the behest of Respondent No. 2, the distinguished
                          Publication houses, Times of India and The Hindu, published defamatorySignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                             Page 3 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48Articles   concerning   the   Petitioner.   The   Petitioner   submitted      his
                          representation to these publication houses requesting them for the removal
                          of the Articles.
12.   The petitioner has claimed that the present Complaint Case bearing
                          No. 2086/2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 was yet
                          another attempt by respondent No.2 to harass the petitioner. The respondent
                          No. 2 by relying on the first Addendum read with the final Settlement, has
                          sought to portray the petitioner has committed criminal breach of trust and
                          cheating. She has concealed the second Addendum entered into between the
                          parties. Moreover, he has impleaded Smt. Khushboo Sachdev, the second
                          wife of the petitioner in the impugned F.I.R., even though she has no
                          concern with any of this controversy.
13.   The petitioner exhausted by the continuous harassment and hoping to
                          achieve peace, the Petitioner paid the Respondent No. 2 Rs. 5,00,000/- on
                          28.12.2022 and an additional Rs. 2,00,000/- on 21.02.2023, over and above
                          the already paid settlement amount.
14.   The petitioner has claimed that he has been dragged into false and
                          frivolous litigation by respondent No. 2, who is a habitual litigant. The
                          petitioner further submits that the IDBI Bank has filed a Petition for
                          initiating personal insolvency of the Petitioner under Section 95 of the
                          Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Consequently, an Interim
                          Moratorium has commenced under Section 96 of the Code. Once an
                          Application under Section 95 IBC is filed, no legal actions or proceedings
                          can be initiated or continued against the personal Guarantor for any debt.
15.   Owing to the interim moratorium in effect, the Respondent No. 2 was
                          unable to pursue or continue any civil proceedings against the Petitioner,Signature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 4 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48including the said Civil Suit. The respondent No. 2 then resorted to the
                          present vexatious Complaint, resulting in registration of the FIR. The
                          petitioner has claimed that the entire Settlement amount in terms of the
                          Settlement Deed stands paid to the Respondent No. 2. Any dispute
                          specifically in regard to this Deed, is purely Civil in nature.
16.   The petitioner has asserted that the allegations in the FIR include
                          breach of trust, cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy, and criminal
                          intimidation. It is alleged in the Complaint by respondent No.2 that the
                          petitioner and his wife have committed multiple fraudulent activities and
                          purportedly induced Respondent No. 2 to sign a settlement Agreement and
                          addendum, promising a payment of Rs. 7 Crores. Allegedly, the Petitioner
                          issued cheques that were dishonored due to insufficient funds, with no
                          intention to honor the payment.
17.   Further allegations are made in the Complaint that the petitioner and
                          his wife intimidated and threatened respondent No.2 to prevent her from
                          pursuing her legal action and coerced her into negotiating a reduction in the
                          Settlement amount.
18. It is stated in the Petition that the impugned FIR No.0126/2024 under
                          Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 against him and his present wife
                          had been registered in compliance of the Order dated 28.05.2024 of the
                          learned MM in Complaint Case bearing no. 2086/2024 titled as â€žGeeta
                          Sachdev vs State of Delhi' filed by the Respondent No. 2, ex-wife of the
                          petitioner. It is asserted that this Order has been obtained by suppressing
                          second and final Addendum dated 11.03.2016 bearing Certification No.
                          INDL254474609476750 e-stamped on 10.03.2016 at 6:48 which was
                          executed between the Petitioner and the Respondent No. 2.
19. It is claimed that her actions are driven by a desire to disrupt the
                          Petitionerâ€Ÿs current marital happiness and to harass them. It is a retaliatory
                          move, aimed at causing distress and disarray in the Petitionerâ€Ÿs well-
                          established and content life, rather than to address any legitimate legal
                          grievance.
20.   It is claimed that the allegations in the Complaint pertain solely to the
                          terms of the Settlement between the petitioner and the respondent No. 2 and
                          non performance of the second Addendum. On these allegations, no criminal
                          offences are made out. Hence, the petitioner has sought the quashing of the
                          FIR. The petitioner has placed reliance onIndian Oil Corporation v. NEPC
                          India Limited and Others2006INSC 452, State of Haryana & Ors. Vs
                          Bhajan Lal & Ors1992 AIR 604, Vishnu Kumar Shukla & Anr. vs the State
                          of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. Crl.Appeal No. 3618/2023,Sajjan Kumar v

                          State of West Bengal2022 SCC OnLine SC 344.
21.   Learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 has argued that two second
                          Addendums were signed on 11.03.2016. The petitioner fraudulently without
                          the respondent No. 2 being aware presented a second Addendum signed on
                          11.03.2016 while she was under the impression of the first Addendum of the
                          same date being the full and final Settlement.
22.    She has further contended that the petitioner was regularly sending
                          her WhatsApp messages and giving the assurance that the balance amount
                          under the first Addendum Settlement shall be paid by him and he did make
                          certain payments to the Respondent No. 2, who remained under a bona fide
                          belief that the petitioner shall be honoring the said Addendum. The copies of
                          the various WhatsApp conversations have also been tendered which areSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                              Page 6 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48taken on record.
23. It is vehemently argued on behalf of the respondent No.2 that there is no
                          ground for quashing of the FIR.
24.   Submissions heard.
25.   The petitioner and the respondent No. 2 are the divorced spouses who
                          had multiple matrimonial litigations which finally culminated into Divorce
                          by Mutual Consent vide Final Decree dated 11.03.2016. During their long
                          acrimonious litigation, the parties entered into three Settlement Deeds; first
                          being 13.08.2015, in which the petitioner had agreed to give her Rs. 5 crores
                          and two immovable properties. This Settlement was presented at the time of
                          First Divorce Petition and was accepted by the parties in their respective
                          Statements before the Family Court and is not under dispute.
26. The other two Agreements dated 11.03.2016, are:
27.   It is not in dispute that the second Addendum dated 11.03.2016 which
                          provided for payment of Rs. 3 crores and two properties, was presented in
                          the Court at the time of recording of Statements of the parties under the
                          Petition for Divorce underSection 13(B)2of Hindu Marriage Act (HMA).
28.   The certified copy of the Judgement under Section (B) 2 HMA
                          specifically records that the parties have amicably resolved all their disputes.

                          wife had already received Rs. 1.5 crore from the husband as was mentioned
                          in the Petition and the statements made by the parties in the Court. Out of
                          the remaining 1.5 crore, a sum of Rs. 1.25 crores has been deposited by way
                          of Bank Draft bearing No. 501589 dated 10.03.2016, drawn on ICICI Bank
                          in favor of Respondent No. 2. The balance 25 lakhs were to be paid to
                          respondent No.2 herein at the time of quashing of FIR No. 147/2011 underSections 323/341/504IPC before the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur
                          Bench. The respondent No. 2 undertook to cooperate and ensure her
                          presence for the quashing of the FIR.
29. The said Judgment further records that the parties had agreed that the
                          petitioner/husband shall be the sole and absolute exclusive owner of
                          residential Apartment bearing No. 1625 B Magnolias, Gold Course Road,
                          Gurugram from the said date and that the Respondent No. 2/wife had

                          her name with regard to the said property. The parties undertook to
                          cooperate with each other for implementation of the said Agreement.
30.   Moreover, it was recorded that the exclusive and absolute title of

                          shall also be with the petitioner. Both the parties undertook to abide by the
                          terms and conditions of the Settlement as was mentioned in their Petition
                          and the MOU/Addendum dated 11.03.2016 exhibited as Ex. P5. After
                          recording the Settlement, the divorce by Mutual Consent underSection
                          13(B)2HMA, was granted.
31.   It is evident that the terms of this Settlement were specificallySignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                             Page 8 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48reproduced and the documents exhibited. In fact,         there was a specific
                          reference that the total cash amount agreed was Rs. 3 crores out of which
                          Rs. 1.5 crores already stood paid while Rs. 1.25 crores were deposited to be
                          released to the respondent No. 2, only after execution of the requisite title
                          documents. Having made specific statements and exhibiting the Agreement
                          as Ex. P-5, the respondent No. 2 cannot now either deny or challenge the
                          Judgement which has never been challenged by respondent No. 2 till date.
                          The contents of this Settlement, which were endorsed and accepted by the
                          Parties before the Court, was duly acted upon and the Divorce was granted.
                          The contention of the respondent No. 2 that she has been cheated or
                          defrauded or was not aware that the second Addendum stamped at 6:48 PM
                          was not presented before the family court is behest of any logic especially
                          when the Order granting the Divorce repeated and affirmed the contents of
                          the Settlement in detail.
32.   There being specific reproduction and re affirmation by the parties of
                          the terms of the Agreement, it cannot be said that she was misled or the
                          terms of the Settlement were misrepresented to her. Therefore, it has to be
                          held that this second Addendum dated 11.03.2006 signed by the Parties at
                          the same time, signatures on which are not denied by her, was a binding
                          Settlement.
33.    The next question which arises is the validity of the first Addendum
                          e-stamped at 6:46 PM on 11.03.2016. 27.       Apparently, it seems that the
                          parties arrived at two Addendum Settlements each of which were
                          independent; one for the purpose of taking divorce by Mutual Consent while
                          the other was for Settlement of other disputes, claims in respect of money
                          and properties. In any case, it is a question of interpretation of the intentionSignature Not VerifiedDigitally Signed          CRL.M.C.6700/2024                                               Page 9 of 11By:VIKAS ARORASigning Date:01.10.202417:17:48of the parties, which they are at liberty to establish in the appropriate Civil
                          Litigation. There is nothing to show that the second Addendum had
                          superseded the first Addendum. This is further corroborated by the fact that
                          the respondent No. 2 never sought repudiation of this Agreement, which was
                          the basis of divorce by mutual consent.
34.    Apparently, the two Addendums signed on 11.03.2016 were intended
                          to be independent of each other; while the second Addendum became the
                          basis for Divorce by Mutual Consent, the grievance against first addendum
                          has been raised only in 2024 by filing a Complaint for registration of FIR.
35. Pertinently, this second Addendum which became the basis of divorce by
                          Mutual Consent does not find any mention in the FIR, which is purely
                          confined to the first Addendum.
36. It is evident that the entire grievance of the respondent No. 2 is in regard
                          to the non compliance of the First Addendum Settlement dated 11.03.2016.
                          The parties have voluntarily entered into it and whatever be the implications,
                          they are essentially civil in nature. Breach of a Settlement would entail only
                          civil liabilities; the essential ingredient of dishonest or fraudulent intention
                          which are the foundation for an offence of Cheating or Breach of Trust, are
                          essentially missing in the present FIR. Significantly, while the Addendum
                          Agreement is of 2016, the Criminal Complaint alleging fraud and breach of
                          Trust vis. a viz. this Agreement, has been filed only in 2024 i.e. after eight
                          years of its execution, leading to registration of impugned FIR.
37.   Consequently, the FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 is hereby
                          quashed along with all the proceedings emanating therefrom, leaving the
                          parties to pursue their civil litigation and other litigation underSection 138NI Act, which have already been initiated.
38.   It is hereby stated that observations made herein is for the purpose of
                          the present petition and are not an expression on the merits of the Settlement
                          Deeds.
39.   The Petition along with other Application, if any is accordingly
                          disposed of.
