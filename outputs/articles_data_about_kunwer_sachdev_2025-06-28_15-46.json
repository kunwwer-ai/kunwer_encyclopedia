    "content": "Kunwer Sachdev\n\nMy journey as an entrepreneur has been anything but ordinary. I never set out to build a multi-million-dollar company, nor did I have a blueprint for success. What I had was an insatiable curiosity, an unyielding determination, and the belief that problems exist only to be solved. Even at the age of 15, I started selling pens to shopkeepers with my brother, which gave me my first experience of sales, a skill that proved invaluable throughout my career.https://kunwersachdev.com/mr-kunwer-sachdev-the-inverter-man-of-india-journey/\n\nI started my career in theCable TV business, learning the ropes of entrepreneurship through sheer experience. I had no formal education in technology or business, yet I was fascinated by how things worked‚Äîhow signals were transmitted, how machines functioned, how innovation could change lives. This curiosity became my biggest strength.\n\nIt was this same curiosity that led me to the world of power backup solutions. In the early days, people in India struggled withfrequent power cuts.Inverters and batteries were unreliable, inefficient, and often made with outdated technology. I saw a gap, an opportunity to create something better. With no background in electronics, I immersed myself in learning, experimenting, and innovating, and that‚Äôs howSu-Kam was born.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam was not easy. There were challenges at every step‚Äîfrom R&D and manufacturing to sales and service. But I believed in the power of perseverance and innovation. We introduced India‚Äôs first MOSFET-based inverter, India‚Äôs first DSP-based inverter, and many other groundbreaking technologies that changed the face of the industry.Su-Kam became more than just a company; it became a revolution. We not only built inverters, UPS systems, and solar solutions but also trained thousands of professionals, setting industry benchmarks.\n\nHowever, life has its twists and turns. Despite all the success, I had to step away from Su-Kam. But true passion never fades, and for me, innovation is not just about business‚Äîit is about making a difference. I knew my journey wasn‚Äôt over. That‚Äôs whenSu-vastika was born.\n\nWith Su-vastika, my vision is even larger. The world is moving towardssustainable energy, smart power backup solutions, and advanced energy storage systems. I am now focusing on creating patented technologies that will shape the future of power solutions‚Äîsolutions that are not just reliable and efficient but also environmentally friendly and future-ready.\n\nToday, Su-vastika is leading the way in Lithium Battery Energy Storage, Solar Energy Innovations, and Automatic Power Backup Systems. We are not just creating products; we are building an ecosystem of knowledge, innovation, and global impact.The AI is the new mantra for products, and we are building AI into each product to make them smart.\n\nOutside of work, I find inspiration and balance in my personal passions‚Äîswimming clears my mind, whistling lifts my spirit, trekking fuels my adventurous side,Yoga keeps me fit and reading keeps my mind sharpand ever-curious. These interests aren‚Äôt just hobbies; they‚Äôre a reflection of the same passion, discipline, and love for exploration that I bring into my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIf my journey has taught me anything, it is thatsuccess is not about what you achieve‚Äîit‚Äôs about the challenges you overcome, the knowledge you share, and the legacy you leave behind.Through Su-vastika, I want to continue pushing the boundaries of technology, inspiring the next generation of innovators, and proving that with determination, India can lead the world in power solutions.\n\nThe journey is far from over.

Known as ‚ÄúThe Inverter Man of India‚Äù and now fondly called ‚ÄúThe Solar Man of India,‚Äù Kunwer is a man who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against him‚Äîand turned that dream into light for millions.\n\nA Spark Ignited Early\n\nKunwer Sachdev was born in a modest home in Delhi, where power cuts were a part of daily life. He wasn‚Äôt born into privilege, nor did he carry a degree from a fancy business school. What he had, however, was far more powerful‚Äîcuriosity, courage, and clarity of purpose. He could see what others overlooked: the quiet suffering of families left in the dark and businesses crippled by unreliable electricity.\n\nWhile others adapted to the darkness, Kunwer chose to challenge it.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam: Lighting Up Lives\n\nIn 1988, with more grit than capital, Kunwer founded Su-Kam Power Systems. He didn‚Äôt just want to build a company‚Äîhe wanted to solve a national problem. From inventing the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter to creating the iconic Home UPS, he turned Su-Kam into a beacon of innovation.\n\nUnder his leadership, Su-Kam wasn‚Äôt just a business‚Äîit was a movement. A movement that brought power, dignity, and stability to homes and villages across India. The company grew from a small setup to a global brand operating in over 90 countries, winning hearts and awards along the way.\n\nBut behind every product was a purpose. And behind every success, a sleepless night of hard work.\n\nA Story Worth Telling\n\nThe world took notice of this self-made man with a mission. Kunwer‚Äôs journey has been chronicled in some of India‚Äôs most inspiring books:\n\n- Booming Brands by Harsh Pamnani ‚Äì capturing how he built Su-Kam into a trusted name from scratch.- Making Breakthrough Innovations Happen by Porus Munshi ‚Äì highlighting his passion for solving India's energy crisis through bold, scalable ideas.- Connect the Dots by Rashmi Bansal ‚Äì showcasing Kunwer as the everyday hero who built an empire without an MBA, but with the school of life as his teacher.\n\nEach page is a tribute to his belief: Innovation is for everyone. Especially the ones who need it most.\n\nReinventing for Tomorrow: Su-vastika & Kunwwer.ai\n\nEven after building one of India‚Äôs most successful power brands, Kunwer didn‚Äôt stop. His heart still beats for the future‚Äîand for those who need it the most.\n\nWith Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., he‚Äôs now tackling the next frontier: energy storage. Through lithium-ion batteries and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), he‚Äôs helping India move towards a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAnd now, with Kunwwer.ai, he‚Äôs stepping into the world of artificial intelligence‚Äîyet again ahead of the curve. His vision: to democratize innovation, using AI to bring smart solutions to energy, education, and business.\n\nMore Than an Entrepreneur\n\nKunwer Sachdev is more than just a successful businessman. He is a mentor, a dreamer, a changemaker. He believes that true success lies not in wealth, but in impact‚Äîin the number of lives touched, the villages lit up, the hope restored.\n\nWords to Live By\n\n‚ÄúIf your innovation solves a real problem, success will chase you.

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience.

  "content": "A Staggering Beginning...\nKunwar had an annual turnover of Rs 3-4 crores and handsome profits. But many big players had entered the field and demand for his product was declining.\nIn 1998, he thought of getting into inverters. Kunwar noticed that everyone was making the same kind of inverters using a sub-standard PCB.\nKnowledge for the sake of knowledge. He learned how different things performed and showed it to his workers.\nKunwar finally managed to launch an inverter but it did not rock the market. He kept on trying and improvising.\nHe bought equipment like the power analyser and meters for testing. The company manufactured just 100 inverters in its first year of operation.\nEven though bigger manufacturers shook their heads, he was determined to make his ideas work. He wanted to make a good product ‚Äî something he was also convinced with.\nHe brought in more people with fresh ideas to work on the inverter.\n\n1989 - Kunwer joined the cable TV business. His job was to convince people to buy the cable TV system. It was a steep learning curve for him.\nHe took 4-5 orders, but due to delay on company‚Äôs part in installation, his clients were dissatisfied. This was a turning point for him.\nHe decided to learn how to install the system and took the help of his high school Physics textbooks to learn the basics.\nHe trained a boy to assist him, and together they started working on installations.\nThis installation business expanded and soon he employed 10 boys.\n\n1992 - There was a boom in the cable TV business and competition in installation increased. Kunwer decided to do something new and started his own cable TV manufacturing company.\nIt was difficult to establish this business, but by 1996‚Äì97, it flourished and he had a factory with 50 workers.\n\nTHE DIFFICULT YEARS...\nHe got offers but refused them, leading to a raid by the excise department.\nHe didn‚Äôt realise that once he became a man of status, people would be after him. This served as a good lesson for him.\nThere were many cases against him. He owed the government a lot of money.\nAll his stocks were sealed and the word spread in the market that the company was taken over.\nHe went into depression.\n\nSu-Kam developed some innovative technologies. Achieved remarkable growth due to superior products, a brand name and strong dealers.\nIn 2007, Sachdev fired some of his old employees. This further caused trouble as they began spreading rumours about the company.\nThe team made an inverter with a small circuit and one battery with much higher efficiency unlike the standard inverter.\nThey had no brand name. Su-Kam was not something people asked by name.\nKunwer contacted an advertising agency and agreed to a budget of Rs 20 lakh.\nHe himself started to learn advertising, which resulted in out-of-the-box ideas.\nThey started TV advertising ‚Äî the only inverter company to do so at the time.\nHe created 3 teams to work on putting posters all around India in dhabas and local shops.\n\nBy 2002, the company‚Äôs turnover was Rs 10 crore.\nThe following year, the company launched a sinewave inverter and an inverter with a plastic body.\n\nEarly Life & Setbacks\nHis father worked in railways but also ran businesses like grocery shops and a tailor shop ‚Äî none of which did well financially.\nThey lived in a railway colony, later moved to Punjabi Bagh.\nHe never sat idle and was always engaged in some work.\nHardships faced by the family included a meagre salary and middle-class struggles ‚Äî even affording a shirt or shoe was a big deal.\nHe shifted to a government school due to financial strain.\nAmidst parental fights and household turmoil, Kunwer became independent.\nHe was never interested in academics, and no one forced him either.\nHe enjoyed helping his brother in business and felt great earning a rupee or two.\n\nCollege & Transformation\nAn experience that changed his personality was joining Hindu College.\nComing from a Hindi medium background, he lacked confidence as everyone there spoke English.\nSomeone suggested reading novels to improve. The first book he picked was ‚ÄúThe Fountainhead‚Äù by Ayn Rand.\nIt took him a week, but he pushed through and eventually read 30 novels.\nHe became a popular student, entered politics, and joined the organizing committee for the cultural fest ‚ÄúMecca.‚Äù\n\nPersonal Life & Career Growth\nHe coined the name 'Su-Kam' for his pens and had plans to build it into a brand.\nHe had trouble adjusting with his brother who didn‚Äôt share his ambition to scale the business. Eventually, he parted ways, causing some family tension.\nAt the time, he was in a relationship with a junior from college. Pressured by her family, he took up a job and joined evening law classes.\nFor the first time, he studied seriously and became the teacher's favourite, but he never intended to practise law.\nEventually, Kunwer and Geeta eloped and started living separately from the family.\nGeeta understood their financial situation and supported the household with her job.\n\nFurther Expansion & Recognition\nHe was again approached with a buyout offer from an American MNC and also from Reliance.\nEventually, a JV between Reliance and Temasek Holdings Singapore invested Rs 45 crore in Su-Kam.\nThis was followed by a golden period of awards and accolades.\nThe Su-Kam lab became a hub for invention ‚Äî inverters running on solar power, advanced storage, and cutting-edge designs.\nNow the company has a professional CEO managing daily operations, allowing Kunwer to focus on bigger dreams."

  "date": "Sep 17, 2024",
  "content": "This case involves a petition by Mr. Kunwer Sachdev for quashing FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 of the IPC, registered at Police Station Connaught Place, New Delhi.\n\nMr. Sachdev was previously married to Ms. Geeta Sachdev and had two sons. Due to disputes, they began living separately in 2009 and later filed for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. A settlement was reached in which Mr. Sachdev agreed to pay Rs. 5 crores and transfer two properties to Ms. Geeta.\n\nTwo Addendum Agreements were signed on 11.03.2016, minutes apart. The second Addendum formed the basis of their final divorce, where the court recorded that Rs. 3 crores was the full and final settlement, and all property transfers were complete. However, Mr. Sachdev was unable to retrieve cheques issued as part of the first Addendum, which Ms. Geeta allegedly misused.\n\nSubsequently, Ms. Geeta filed multiple legal complaints including under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and a civil suit to recover Rs. 4.05 crores. The petitioner also claimed defamation due to articles in Times of India and The Hindu.\n\nMr. Sachdev asserted that the latest complaint was a misuse of legal process and that the inclusion of his second wife, Ms. Khushboo Sachdev, in the FIR was unjustified. He cited that the matter was civil in nature and not criminal. Additionally, insolvency proceedings under Section 95 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 had initiated an interim moratorium against legal actions.\n\nThe Court noted that the second Addendum was the operative and accepted document, and that any grievance related to the first Addendum is civil, not criminal. No elements of cheating or criminal breach of trust were found.\n\nTherefore, the Hon'ble Court ruled that FIR No. 0126/2024 is to be quashed, with liberty for the parties to pursue civil remedies or existing Section 138 proceedings. The judgment clarified that these observations are limited to this quashing petition and do not impact merits of civil litigation.\n\nJudge: Neena Bansal Krishna\nDate: September 17, 2024"

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev‚Äôs legacy alive in the power backup industry.\n\nUpdated WTC 2025-27 points table after Australia beat West Indies, Sri Lanka win series against Bangladesh; India at....\n\nMeet Parag Jain, appointed new RAW chief, who led crucial operation, including the biggest against Pakistan,¬†it¬†is...\n\nSocial worker Ritu Narang wins 'Spirit of Yoga' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nBangladesh Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto takes BIG step after losing series against Sri Lanka\n\nVersha Verma, Lucknow-based judo player and poet, wins 'Humanitarian of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n13 soldiers killed, 6 children injured in suicide bombing in Pakistan, here's what we know so far\n\nPankaj Bhadouria wins Super Chef of the Year award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nPadma Shri Dr Soniya Nityanand wins 'Light of India' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nWarren Buffett takes big decision, donates Rs 51000 crore in Berkshire Shares to..., reason is...\n\nSuparna Sarkar wins Breaking Barriers award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nViral Video: Owner of Mahindra Scorpio parks car in an unusual place, internet jokes, 'Show¬†room¬†feeling'\n\nMLC 2025: Shimron Hetmyer does THIS against Kieron Pollard on last ball during Seattle Orcas vs MI New York match\n\nTrapped in Rs 499 EMIs: The silent financial crisis of India‚Äôs young generation\n\nShah Rukh Khan's KKR star batter to join Uttar Pradesh education department, Yogi govt to give him salary of Rs..., he is...\n\nSwati Kapoor, who provides 'Thaal Sewa' to over 1200 people daily, wins 'Social Worker of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n'Kashi Ki Didi' Ranjubala Singh wins 'Warrior Spirit' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nICAI to cap individual CA annual audits to 60, from..., president says, ‚ÄòCA can also carry out...‚Äô\n\nWho is Elizabeth MacDonough?

    "content": "Kunwer Sachdev, founder and managing director, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited, has helped catapult the company from a start-up to one of the fastest growing companies in the country in a short span of time. Born in a middle-class family in Delhi, Sachdev, with no technological background, founded a company that is today known for its technologically advanced products.\n\nSachdev has a degree in mathematical statistics and law from Delhi University. In 1998, he ventured into the power backup solutions business, sett-ing up Su-Kam. Today, the company has operations across 90 countries. Prior to this, he was involved in the cable television business. Under Sachdev‚Äôs leadership, Su-Kam has achieved several firsts to its credit. It has filed over 100 patents for technology and design in the power backup industry, the highest for any Indian company. It has also launched the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter, which has been declared as the Innovation of the Decade by India Today. ‚ÄúThese innovations were possible only due to the robust research and development unit of Su-Kam. Innovation and sophistication in products is my passion,‚Äù says Sachdev.\n\nHe sees scope for major growth in the solar power space. He has led the development of innovative solar solutions ‚Äì off-grid and on-grid systems ‚Äì¬† to cater to the needs of a range of consumers.\n\nOn the state of the power sector, Sachdev says, ‚ÄúElectricity is critical to power the economic growth of the country. India is on the road to development, but to accelerate growth, it is critical to ensure the availability of uninterrupted power supply. In today‚Äôs scenario, we lack the infrastructure to meet the growing demand for power.‚Äù He further underscores the importance of renewable energy to offset the demand for conventional fuels as well as to pave the way for cleaner solutions. ‚ÄúA green economy is the need of the hour,‚Äù he says.\n\nSachdev also has a flair for marketing, which has led him to launch several innovative branding initiatives for the company. Moreover, he sees internal branding as an important strategy to engage with employees. His peers see him as a leader, who has a novel approach towards solving tough problems. He is also an ardent sports enthusiast, with swimming and running being his favourites. Going forward, Sachdev aims to make Su-Kam a market leader in technology and innovation or ‚Äútechnovation‚Äù, as he calls it.\n\n\n\nSubscribeSeptember Issue\n\nCOPYRIGHT ¬© 2017-2022  | POWER LINE\n\nGET ACCESS TO OUR ARTICLESEnter your email addressSubscribe to NewsletterPlease leave this field empty.Œî\n\n\n\nGET ACCESS TO OUR ARTICLES\n\nEnter your email address\n\n\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\n\n\nDownload Rate Card for Overseas Companies\n\nVerify Code (required)\n\nŒî\n\n\n\nDownload Rate Card for Indian Companies\n\nVerify Code (required)\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\n\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\n\n\nŒî"

  "date": "Sep 17, 2024",
  "content": "The Petition under Section 528 of BNSS, 2023 was filed by Mr. Kunwer Sachdev for quashing FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 of the IPC, registered at Police Station Connaught Place, New Delhi.\n\nMr. Sachdev was married to Ms. Geeta Sachdev on 25.09.1987 at Arya Samaj Mandir, and they have two sons. Due to irreconcilable differences, the parties have lived separately since September 2009. They jointly filed a Petition for Divorce under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, agreeing to a settlement of Rs. 5 crores and transfer of two immovable properties to Ms. Geeta.\n\nThe Settlement Deed dated 13.08.2015 was accepted, and the first motion of divorce was passed on 14.08.2015. Two Addendum Agreements were executed on 11.03.2016 ‚Äî the first stamped at 6:46 PM, the second at 6:48 PM.\n\nThe second Addendum was presented to the Court in support of the mutual divorce, confirming the full and final settlement amount as Rs. 3 crores. Based on this, the divorce was granted.\n\nMr. Sachdev claimed he was unable to retrieve cheques issued under the first Addendum, which were later deposited by Ms. Geeta. She filed a Complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and a Civil Suit seeking Rs. 4.05 crores with 12% interest.\n\nAdditionally, defamatory articles were published against him in Times of India and The Hindu. He claimed the FIR was another attempt by Ms. Geeta to harass him. She allegedly relied only on the first Addendum, ignoring the second.\n\nThe complaint also named his second wife, Khushboo Sachdev, although she had no connection to the dispute. Mr. Sachdev later paid Rs. 5,00,000 on 28.12.2022 and Rs. 2,00,000 on 21.02.2023 to avoid further conflict.\n\nDue to his insolvency proceedings under Section 95 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a moratorium under Section 96 had begun, barring legal action against him. As a result, civil proceedings by Ms. Geeta had to be halted.\n\nMr. Sachdev asserted that the FIR included unfounded allegations of breach of trust, cheating, conspiracy, and intimidation. The complaint accused him of inducing Ms. Geeta into signing settlement agreements and issuing dishonored cheques without intent to pay.\n\nFurther, he was accused of threatening her to settle for less. He contended that the complaint was based on the first Addendum alone, while the second Addendum was the final, court-approved agreement.\n\nThe respondent alleged that she believed the first Addendum was final and accused Mr. Sachdev of fraudulently presenting the second Addendum. She claimed she relied on his WhatsApp messages assuring balance payment.\n\nAfter hearing submissions, the court noted the following:\n- The parties had three settlement agreements: one in August 2015, two on 11.03.2016.\n- The second Addendum (Rs. 3 crore + 2 properties) was presented and accepted in Court during the second motion for mutual divorce.\n- Rs. 1.5 crores had been paid, Rs. 1.25 crores was deposited by bank draft, and the balance Rs. 25 lakhs was to be paid upon quashing another FIR.\n\nThe court held that:\n- The second Addendum was binding.\n- There is no evidence the second Addendum replaced the first.\n- Allegations arise from breach of civil agreement, not criminal acts.\n- There was an 8-year delay in filing the complaint.\n\nThe Court concluded that the FIR was without merit, based on civil issues, and lacked ingredients of cheating or breach of trust. Therefore:\n\nFIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 was quashed, and related proceedings were dropped. Civil and NI Act proceedings may continue. Observations in this judgment do not affect the merits of other cases.\n\nJudge: Neena Bansal Krishna\nDate: September 17, 2024"

    "content": "Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev built his company's fortune by cashing in on an unreliable power grid. Now, he's looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit\n\nWhen he turned 15, Kunwer Sachdev began helping his older brother sell pens to shops in Delhi. It was the late 1970s, and the nation‚Äôs capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India‚Äôs largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices‚Äîwhich he didn‚Äôt have access to when he was growing up‚Äîthat provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.Power outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world‚Äôs population, don‚Äôt have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.These days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs promise of replicating Gujarat‚Äôs 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It‚Äôs also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit.Su-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.‚ÄúWe started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don‚Äôt have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I‚Äôm already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,‚Äù says Sachdev.He may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. ‚ÄúWe started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,‚Äù he says.Su-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.Su-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.At the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚ÄùA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines.Subscribe Now(This story appears in the 12 December, 2014 issue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Forbes India.

You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.\n\nSu-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.At the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚ÄùA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines.Subscribe Now(This story appears in the 12 December, 2014 issue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Forbes India.

    "content": "Founder & CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems\n\nFebruary 11, 2015 6:12 am/2 Commentson ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù to reduce India‚Äôs electronics import¬†bill\n\nMake in Indiais the biggest initiative launched by our Prime Minister to attract investors to our country and to encourage them to manufacture in India. This one campaign will provide the much needed boost to India‚Äôs economy by creating jobs, making India a self reliant economy and getting the country its rightful place under the sun. The Prime Minister has also set very high targets for the focus sectors.\n\n\n\nMrKunwer Sachdeva, Managing Director Su-Kam Power Systems, while speaking to a team fromIndia Infoline(IIFL) lauded the Prime Minister‚Äôs initiative, especially in the Solar Sector. Under the National Solar Mission, the Prime Minister has enhanced the goal from 20 GW of solar energy by 2020 to 100 GW, a huge step. Mr Sachdev believes that this target though achievable would require a slew of investors, manufacturers, and other involvement of many stakeholders.\n\nThe Inverter Man of India is very upbeat about India‚Äôs performance based on the steps taken byNarendra Modi. A number of new technologies are being developed in India. Su-Kam well symbolises Make in India ‚Äì for over 15 years now the company has been innovating and manufacturing in India. The company holds close to 100 design patents in India, USA and other countries, and over 100 technology patents. Today the company files a minimum of 30 patents a year. However, Mr Sachdeva believes that the Patent granting system in the country leaves a lot to be desired. The patents that Su-Kam has filed for over six years ago are yet to be granted. In today‚Äôs dynamic world technology changes very fast and some of these have already become obsolete.\n\nThis needs to be fixed very quickly. Having said that there is no doubt that the Make in India initiative will ensure that a large number of companies start manufacturing in India, thus generating employment and improving the standard of living in the country.\n\n\n\nMr Sachdeva also believes that this initiative can have a major impact at India‚Äôs macro-economic picture. For instance, if we were to only focus on the electronics industry, there is much that can be achieved. According to industry experts, India‚Äôs electronic imports may surpass its oil import bill by 2030. Keeping the current oil prices in view, this aim may also be achieved by 2025. Currently the annual imports stand at over USD 35 billion!\n\nFirm laws and a fast paced administrative machinery are critical to the success of the Make in India campaign, said Mr Kunwer Sachdev while speaking to the IIFL team.\n\nJanuary 12, 2015 6:00 am/16 Commentson Inverter Man of India ‚Äì Always a Step¬†Ahead!\n\n\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev has been aptly given the title of the ‚ÄúInverter Man of India‚Äù. Frustrated over a malfunctioning inverter at his house he opened the inverter and studied the reasons for its continuous failure. Little did he know then that he was taking the first step toward revolutionising an industry that was highly unorganised.\n\n\n\nWhen he opened that inverter,Kunwer Sachdevaalso did not realise that with that one action he was about to script his life‚Äôs story of rags to riches. Mr Sachdev hails from a very humble background and spent his early career selling pens. He faced numerous challenges at every step, however he never deterred, building his company from strength to strength. He always searched for an opportunity when faced with a problem, rather than giving up he tried to find a solution and move ahead.\n\nThoughKunwer Sachdevhad no formal training in electronics or an engineering degree, he built a power backup solutions company known globally for products backed by world class technology. Mr Sachdeva‚Äôs vision, entrepreneurial capability and determination led him to build Su-Kam into a Superbrand.\n\nAn innovation driven company, Su-Kam is always a step ahead of the industry.Kunwer Sachdeva, who built Su-Kam into a Rs 1000 crore plus company realised early on that Solar is the answer to India‚Äôs growing power needs. Su-Kam has a very strong R&D which is constantly working on developing innovative solar solutions. That day is perhaps not far when the Inverter Man of India will get renamed as the Solar Man of India.\n\nNovember 28, 2014 11:08 am/27 Commentson The Inverter Man of India runs the Airtel Half¬†Marathon\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev, also known as the Inverter Man of India, ran the Airtel Half Marathon on November 23, 2014 in Delhi. Achieving a time of 2hrs 21 mins, he ran 21 kms. Mr Sachdev is an avid sports person and a swimmer. He found the time to run the marathon despite his busy schedule, as he was determined to do so this year.Mr Kunwer Sachdeva believes in the saying ‚Äú‚ÄùFinishing a marathon is a state of mind that says ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE‚Äù. Running the marathon has been just that for him ‚Äì breaking a mental barrier that it is difficult to run 21 kms at a stretch.\n\n\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdeva has lived his life by the saying ‚ÄúAnything is Possible‚Äù ‚Äì overcoming challenges and proving it right over and over again. Coming from a very humble background, Mr Kunwer Sachdeva has built a Rs. 1200 crore company. Though academically he is not a technical person, he is credited with transforming the inverter industry from a non-technical industry into a highly technologically advanced industry!\n\nEven after running the half marathon, Mr Sachdeva‚Äôs batteries were as charged as those manufactured by his company. Ask him where he gets this energy from, and he says it is his determination and grit to achieve the impossible and break barriers that drive him. This is why he emerges victorious over and over again.\n\nJune 9, 2014 7:01 am/Leave a comment\n\nIndiaMART & ET NOW joined hands to present ‚ÄòIndiaMART Leaders of Tomorrow Awards‚Äô to recognise the contribution of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in driving India‚Äôs march to global stardom. The mission of the awards was to acknowledge the importance of SMEs in increasing trade, generating employment & creating new entrepreneurs in India,along with a commitment to develop a strong SME eco-system.\n\nIndia mart & ET Now invites Mr. Kunwer Sachdev\n\nThe finale of the award ceremony was organized in The Oberoi, New Delhi, and the chief guest being Mr. K. V. Kamath, non-executive chairman ICICI BANK.\n\nMr. Kunwer Sachdevwas invited as a special guest since he in the earlier years had been a part of the SME‚Äôs and successfully led Su-Kam out of the category into large scale eneterprises. Mr.Kunwer Sachdev gave away the awards along with Mr. K.V. Kamath to encourage and felicitate the winners.\n\nMay 21, 2014 6:40 am/5 Commentson Kunwer Sachdeva\n\nFounder & MD of Su-Kam Power Systems\n\nKunwar Sachdeva, the Founder and MD of Su-Kam, is popularly known as the inverter man of India who revolutionized the inverter industry. A DU law graduate determined to bring about new technology and innovation to the inverter industry in India and to organize the same; he sowed the seeds of Su-Kam and created a new breed of problem-free inverters calledSu-Kam.\n\n\n\nKunwer Sachdeva started his journey to success quite early in life. He started out as a cable TV operator and went on to dealing in power inverters. Su-Kam is currently the best and number one inverter company in India.

    "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention. It mostly consists of the \"Bharat Shiromani\" award given by the Indian government and the Ernst & Young \"Best Industrialist of the Year\" honor. ¬†Kunwar Sachdev's biography, it is clear that talent alone may make a person successful without needing a degree as you know that despite being successful, Bill Gates and Facebook are former students of Mark Zuckerberg College.\n\n\n\nRead More News :\n\nStepping out of the Domestic Threshold, becoming the Richest Mother\n\nIndia's retail king, Radhakishan Damani\n\n¬© 2025 siliconindia.com All rights reserved.Attorneys Near Me|Attorneys"

    "content": "Solar Man Of India:One of the finest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary businessmen of our time is Kunwer Sachdev, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's premier provider of power solutions. Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.\n\nTrending Photos\n\nSuccess Story:The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.Kunwer Sachdev: Rags To RichesA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.Su-Kam- The Unmatched ProductHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members.

    "content": "The introduction of electricity transformed the way our lives for decades, but the growing numbers of shortages and their lengthening frequency made the power backup industry necessary. Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India. The company is one of the most rapidly growing and progressive businesses in the country. Sachdev has been an inspiration to many who have proven that dreams do come true if we put in our dedication and hard work with the right energy.\n\nKunwer Sachdev was raised in the family of a railway clerk in Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh neighbourhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, he started working in his brother‚Äôs pen business. Due to continuous power outrage, he quickly understood that there was a huge potential in the field of power backup. With the challenges of a severe power deficit, he decided to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer had a difficult time bringing investment for his business but it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to some issues. He then improved them and made them better than the ones available in the market. After much research, he approached dealers and wholesalers. Even though the market was already crowded with various brands Su-kam‚Äôs inverters were unmatched in terms of price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam became the first company in the power industry which initiated exporting its products to the international markets.\n\nHe envisioned a Make in India campaign and his company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. He has also captured the markets in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa and Nepal where his products were valued for their quality and reliability.\n\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n\nKunwer expanded Su-Kam and made the brand widely known for its proficiency in the solar energy industry. However, due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam went into bankruptcy. Its assets were also frozen. All the services were closed instantly. Due to this, dealers, distributors and customers suffered due to lack of services.\n\nAfter so many hurdles, his wife Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help give services to the customers.  Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev with the help of her friends and distributors. The company has been able to give several services to dealers, distributors and customers. Now, the company will be filing for over 60 patents with 6 under their name.\n\nLatest Blogs"

    "content": "BUSINESS\n\nKunwar Sachdev is the man who once sold pens door-to-door and worked as a marketer to fund his education before founding a company worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nRitik Raj\n\nUpdated :Feb 08, 2024, 10:09 AM IST| Edited by :Ritik Raj\n\nSetting goals and achieving goals are two different things because winners and losers have the same goals, but most fail and few win. Kunwar Sachdev is one such example of achieving his goal. The saying \"one thought changes your entire life\" is often heard but rarely demonstrated. Kunwar Sachdev, for example, used to make a little money by selling pens door to door. One day, however, he had an idea and decided to invest some money to launch a successful business that is now operating not just in India but also in many other countries.\n\nGrowing up in the family of a railway clerk, Kunwer Sachdev is a dreamer who has become a great inspiration in India's power backup industry. His path, characterized by inventiveness and perseverance, demonstrates the transforming potential of commitment. Kunwar had raised the money for his education by going door-to-door to sell pens. He had given up on his dream of becoming a doctor since he could not get medical admission.\n\nWhile working in marketing for a cable company after graduating, Kunwar Sachdev learned that the industry has a lot of room to grow and that not all challenges must be overcome from the start. He just quit his job and founded Su-Kam Communication, which subsequently concentrated solely on producing solar-related products.\n\nThe company owned by Kunwar Sachdev manufactures a variety of solar products that are in high demand in India and abroad. Kunwar Sachdev reportedly owns businesses worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nUpdated WTC 2025-27 points table after Australia beat West Indies, Sri Lanka win series against Bangladesh; India at....\n\nMeet Parag Jain, appointed new RAW chief, who led crucial operation, including the biggest against Pakistan,¬†it¬†is...\n\nSocial worker Ritu Narang wins 'Spirit of Yoga' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nBangladesh Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto takes BIG step after losing series against Sri Lanka\n\nVersha Verma, Lucknow-based judo player and poet, wins 'Humanitarian of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n13 soldiers killed, 6 children injured in suicide bombing in Pakistan, here's what we know so far\n\nPankaj Bhadouria wins Super Chef of the Year award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nPadma Shri Dr Soniya Nityanand wins 'Light of India' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nWarren Buffett takes big decision, donates Rs 51000 crore in Berkshire Shares to..., reason is...\n\nSuparna Sarkar wins Breaking Barriers award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nViral Video: Owner of Mahindra Scorpio parks car in an unusual place, internet jokes, 'Show¬†room¬†feeling'\n\nMLC 2025: Shimron Hetmyer does THIS against Kieron Pollard on last ball during Seattle Orcas vs MI New York match\n\nTrapped in Rs 499 EMIs: The silent financial crisis of India‚Äôs young generation\n\nShah Rukh Khan's KKR star batter to join Uttar Pradesh education department, Yogi govt to give him salary of Rs..., he is...\n\nSwati Kapoor, who provides 'Thaal Sewa' to over 1200 people daily, wins 'Social Worker of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n'Kashi Ki Didi' Ranjubala Singh wins 'Warrior Spirit' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nICAI to cap individual CA annual audits to 60, from..., president says, ‚ÄòCA can also carry out...‚Äô\n\nWho is Elizabeth MacDonough?

Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.",

    "content": "Success Story: The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.\n\nKunwer Sachdev: Rags To Riches\n\nA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.\n\nSu-Kam- The Unmatched Product\n\nHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.\n\nSu-Kam: Monopoly\n\nThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.\n\nSu-Kam Bankruptcy\n\nSu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.\n\nKhushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In Disguise\n\nCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.\n\nSu-Vastika And The Power Woman\n\nUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.\n\nThe brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did. And he is not done yet."

Through YouTube, he aims to provide valuable marketing information and practical knowledge that he has gained over the years of developing multiple brands out of nothing.",
    "content": "When discussing the innovation brought into the Indian power backup industry, the Inverter Man of India himself Kunwer Sachdev seems to be at the forefront. As the founder of Su-Kam and now mentor of the Indian startup Su-vastika, Kunwer has changed how we view inverters/UPS by converting every problem into an opportunity. Kunwer Sachdev has now taken up a new challenge: to educate entrepreneurs and SMEs to market themselves in this increasingly competitive age. Keeping that goal in mind, Kunwer Sachdev has launched his own personal YouTube channel, where he aims to share his in-depth knowledge of branding, marketing, and sales, helping young entrepreneurs build their footing in the market.\n\nKunwer Sachdev‚Äôs YouTube channel stands head and shoulder above other business channels, as it will be full of insights from his own experience of creating India‚Äôs #1 inverter/UPS company. Through YouTube, he aims to provide valuable marketing information and practical knowledge that he has gained over the years of developing multiple brands out of nothing. The format is very easy to consume, as he appears in honest conversations both with hosts and the audience, connecting with their burning questions and sharing practical knowledge and insights that no other mentor can provide.\n\nMarketing, Branding, and Building a Lasting Legacy\n\nOne of Kunwer Sachdev‚Äôs latest videos on his channel tackles Branding, Culture, and Intellectual Property (IP). Creating something lasting is more critical than focusing only on technical details. He discusses what distinguishes a brand beyond a catchy tagline or logo. To Kunwer, a brand is the story you tell‚Äîone that reflects your values and creates a connection with your customers. Advertisement\n\nBut he doesn‚Äôt stop at branding. Kunwer knows that a positive company culture is the secret ingredient behind a thriving business. In his video, he highlights how the internal atmosphere of a company‚Äîits spirit, its shared beliefs‚Äîcan directly shape how customers perceive it. A happy, motivated team often means happy, loyal customers. It‚Äôs the insight from running a business where you‚Äôve seen all the ups, downs, and everything\n\nA Modern Approach to Personal Branding\n\nIn his latest video, Kunwer delves into personal branding and its pivotal role in today‚Äôs business environment. He elaborates how social identity built through personal brand laurels makes it easier to engage trust with the clients and customers in the business. But it is not only an act of self-adoration; the show‚Äôs appeal lies in being genuine and genuine only. Sachdev subtly emphasizes that in a world where digital presence matters, who you are as a leader can be just as important as what your business offers.\n\nBuilding a Strong Office Culture\n\nAnother key theme of the video is cultivating a positive office culture. Kunwer talks about how internal business culture can be the cornerstone of a solid external culture that defines employee motivation and organizational image. He breaks the lion‚Äôs share of the information on how an entrepreneur can foster a culture that encourages innovation with cooperation to fuel growth. His guidance is realistic and grounded, providing concise management wisdom that can be a good start in building the organizational culture.\n\nSafeguarding Your Innovations with IP\n\nKunwer also touches on protecting intellectual property, offering precious guidance for startups and small businesses. Although he does not go into much detail, he clarifies that to remain relevant in this business, one must protect one‚Äôs creative property. As long as business people know the elementary facts concerning IP protection, one can turn into a groundbreaking aspect they never considered over the fear of copyright infringement.\n\nA Blend of Strategy and Experience\n\nNot only does he successfully unite both strategic perspectives in his videos, but he also shares his own experience as an entrepreneur. He invites other business experts to give his viewers a broader view of how one can create and develop a successful enterprise. His advice is theoretical and practical, and he applies these concepts to strategies that entrepreneurs can implement when facing challenges.\n\nDemystifying the World of Digital Marketing\n\nMany novice business owners may need help to handle the internet world. To what extent can a company differentiate its brand? Lastly, an ever-learning Kunwer on YouTube tries to explain digital marketing in easily consumable chunks. His primary concern is to prove that you cannot use vast amounts of money in brand building, not to mention an ad agency‚Äôs approval on social media platforms. A clear message, consistency, and an authentic voice would be best.\n\nKunwer also discusses how social media is not just about becoming a screaming chamber and shouting top slogans for advertisements. It‚Äôs about conversations, relationships, telling stories, and providing value to people. It is a counsel as fundamental as it may seem implemental for a small business struggling to market itself in a flooded market.\n\nSo, not only is he a teacher, but he also knows what his viewers are going through. He knows the feeling of wondering whether you‚Äôre targeting the right audience‚Äîif your message is getting through or not. But that makes the advice unique; he has lived it and become a winner.\n\nPractical Tips, Not Just Theory\n\nThe particularity of Kunwer‚Äôs channel is that he tells it as it is, refreshing in the seas of polished ‚Äòpositive mindset‚Äô content. At one time or another, he couldn‚Äôt care less about premising himself on the ability to deliver a barrage of theories which, for all you know, could be filled with hot air; this man is all about solutions; it‚Äôs about being practical. Throughout the passage, he talks about how to build a brand story or defend your idea, and, in each case, it is always about what can assist an entrepreneur at this particular time.\n\nHe knows this is a reality for many business owners, that the day-to-day involves doing many different things very often. One minute, the marketer is smiling at you; the next, it‚Äôs the customer service rep who is as accessible as your cubical partner, and sometimes you find yourself replacing the cleaner. Kunwer‚Äôs videos acknowledge this reality, offering advice that respects the hustle and recognizes small business owners‚Äô challenges.\n\nAnd he‚Äôs not just talking to people with fancy MBAs or big marketing budgets. His content is designed for those building a brand from their living room or juggling a side hustle while working full-time. It‚Äôs the kind of mentorship that‚Äôs accessible and down-to-earth, just like Kunwer himself.\n\nA Community for Entrepreneurs Who Think Big\n\nIn addition to the videos, Kunwer encourages other entrepreneurs who dream big but know it depends on small things. He encourages the viewers to comment on the videos, tell their experiences, and ask questions‚Äîthus making his channel not just about streaming videos. It produces a place to get people to learn from, mentor, and befriend other budding business people.\n\nKunwer‚Äôs vision for the channel is simple but powerful: He hopes to experience considerable success following trends that apply new modes of constructing resilient, adaptable, and, most importantly, genuine businesses. Looking at the life of Bill Gates, he shows that it is possible to go from receiving very tough tasks from your employers and yet turn them into incremental steps towards success.\n\nConclusion\n\nKnowing how to conduct brand marketing online is essential as the globe becomes more digitally integrated. It‚Äôs often a real challenge for most entrepreneurs, especially those newly establishing their own companies, to find reliable and cheap sources of guidance. Kunwer Sachdev‚Äôs YouTube channel meets this need, offering a blend of marketing wisdom and entrepreneurial empathy that is rare to find.\n\nBut what is truly remarkable is how, in doing so, Kunwer employs the arc of his life story. He has lived the journey from having a rapidly growing business to facing challenges squarely. Today, he uses that experience to illuminate the way for other people in the same business as him and make it easier for them.\n\nIn an age where it certainly isn‚Äôt easy to identify everyone‚Äôs niche, Kunwer‚Äôs channel is as refreshing as it gets. It‚Äôs a place where you can be taught by someone who has been through it and can tell you that the journey is not easy but worthwhile.\n\nTo remain connected, subscribe to Kunwer Sachdev‚Äôs YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@KunwerSachddev"

    "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention. It mostly consists of the \"Bharat Shiromani\" award given by the Indian government and the Ernst & Young \"Best Industrialist of the Year\" honor. Kunwar Sachdev's biography, it is clear that talent alone may make a person successful without needing a degree as you know that despite being successful, Bill Gates and Facebook are former students of Mark Zuckerberg College."

    "content": "Image: Amit Verma Kunwer Sachdev, founder and CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd\n\nWhen he turned 15, Kunwer Sachdev began helping his older brother sell pens to shops in Delhi. It was the late 1970s, and the nation‚Äôs capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India‚Äôs largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices‚Äîwhich he didn‚Äôt have access to when he was growing up‚Äîthat provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.\n\n\n\nPower outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world‚Äôs population, don‚Äôt have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.\n\n\n\nThese days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs promise of replicating Gujarat‚Äôs 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It‚Äôs also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit.\n\n\n\nSu-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWe started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don‚Äôt have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I‚Äôm already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,‚Äù says Sachdev.\n\n\n\nHe may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. ‚ÄúWe started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,‚Äù he says.\n\n\n\nSu-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nSu-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAshish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.\n\n\n\nSachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011. ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.\n\n\n\nHe‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).\n\n\n\nThat said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.\n\n\n\nHe wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.\n\n\n\nLike many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.\n\n\n\nBut 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.\n\n\n\nIn two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.\n\n\n\nIn 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.\n\n\n\nAlthough Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚Äù\n\n\n\nA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines."

    "content": "Su-kam founder and mentor at Su-vastika, Mr. Kunwer Sachdev, has shared his thoughts on India's progress in Battery Management Systems (BMS), establishing the nation as a world leader in this quickly developing field. In his most recent article, \"India's BMS Advancements: A Global Game-Changer,\" Sachdev talks about the revolutionary potential of Indian innovation in BMS technology, namely in energy storage systems, renewable energy applications, and the electric vehicle (EV) business. As per Kunwer Sachdev, \"India is set to outshine China in BMS for Lithium Batteries, becoming a leader in the next five years.\"\n\nSachdev, the creator of Su-kam Power Systems Ltd. and a pioneer in the Indian battery sector considers his path and the advancement of BMS technology. Twelve years ago, Su-kam created a BMS, especially for lead-acid batteries. It addressed essential problems like water replenishing and cell balancing, frequently resulting in early battery failures. This early attempt at BMS creation established the groundwork for an industry in India that is expanding quickly, especially with the rise in demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nInnovation and Technological Progress in BMS\n\nSachdev outlines the advancements in BMS technology throughout his article. While today's BMS solutions are driven by specialized chips with pre-loaded features, development once depended on specially developed microcontrollers and embedded software. This led to faster and more efficient development. These developments have enabled a new generation of Indian BMS producers to develop state-of-the-art systems that satisfy the expanding need for lithium-ion battery management across various industries worldwide.\n\nSachdev notes that businesses like Su-vastika, which is creating double-layered BMS protection systems for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), are at the forefront of this movement. These technologies guarantee lithium-ion batteries, vital for electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and electronic applications, as well as safety and peak performance. India's emphasis on BMS protection with many layers is turning out to be essential for improving battery life and dependability.\n\nIndia's Ascent to the Top of the World BMS Technology Market\n\nIndia's BMS producers are ready to challenge the hegemony of China and other international competitors. Despite China's historical dominance, India is becoming a strong competitor in the BMS market because of its advanced technological know-how and domestic production capacity. Sachdev highlights that three crucial characteristics that distinguish Indian manufacturers are real-time data analysis, remote monitoring, and the integration of BMS systems with energy storage.\n\nIndian BMS solutions are addressing the complex demands of the contemporary energy landscape with their comprehensive software and firmware capabilities, enabling smooth integration with renewable energy systems and energy grids. Sachdev also draws attention to the fact that Indian BMS systems provide all-inclusive service and support, setting them apart from many Chinese providers who frequently struggle to provide localized customer support.\n\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship\n\nKunwer Sachdev also talks about how important innovation and entrepreneurship are to India's growth in the BMS industry. He talks about his encounters with forward-thinking businesspeople pushing the limits of BMS technology in India.\n\n\"The passion and drive of these entrepreneurs have reinforced my belief in the potential of Indian BMS manufacturers,\" Sachdev states. \"Their technical expertise and innovative spirit are driving India to the forefront of the global BMS market.\"\n\nOvercoming Obstacles and Gazing Toward the Future\n\nSachdev is upbeat despite admitting the difficulties Indian BMS companies confront, especially in marketing and distribution. He is of the opinion that Indian BMS manufacturers can achieve global competitiveness by means of sustained investment in research and development, strategic foreign alliances, and an advanced marketing strategy.\n\nSachdev sees a time when India leads the world in BMS technology and exports a significant amount of these innovative products. Indian BMS companies may establish new standards in the global market and solidify their position as innovators by placing a high value on technical proficiency and customer service.\n\nAbout Kunwer Sachdev\n\nKunwer Sachdev is a trailblazing businessman, founder of Sukam and Mentor at Suvastika, and inventor frequently called the \"Father of the Inverter Industry in India.\" Having founded Su-kam Power Systems Ltd., Sachdev has been instrumental in many advances in the fields of energy storage and batteries. Even though Su-kam is no longer connected to him, his influence still shapes the sector. Sachdev encourages the upcoming generation of entrepreneurs to question the status quo and bring India to the forefront of the world economy through his thought leadership on websites like LinkedIn.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany Name:CB Herald\n\nContact Person: Ray\n\nEmail:Send Email\n\nCity: Gurugram\n\nCountry: India\n\nWebsite:cbherald.com\n\n\n\nPress Release Distributed by ABNewswire.com\n\nTo view the original version on ABNewswire visit: India Set to Outshine China in BMS for Lithium Batteries in the next 5 years"

India‚Äôs largest power solutions company Kunwer Sachdev was honored for his exemplary contribution to the Indian solar and power backup industry.\n\nAmong the other dignitaries honored on the occasion were Dr. Cyrus S Poonawala, Serum Institute India, Adi Godrej, Godrej Industries, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Biocon, Byju Raveendran, and Byju‚Äôs, Abhishek Lodha, Lodha Group, Rana Kapoor, Yes Bank and the like.\n\nFounded by Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report is a luxury publisher group. It currently has offices in London, Mumbai, Shanghai and LA. The Hurun Most Respected Entrepreneur Award was first established in 1999. This annual award focuses on two growing economies China and India.\n\nThe Award is set up to recognise the success stories of entrepreneurs and talk about their stories on a global platform. Hurun Report India is piloted by Anas Rahman Junaid, MD and Chief Researcher. Its objective is to promote the success stories of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs on global platforms.\n\n‚ÄúI am honored to receive this distinction. It has been an arduous yet memorable journey. I would also like to thank all my mentors, well-wishers and friends who have been a part of this incredible journey.‚Äù said Kunwer Sachdev.\n\nPopularly known as the ‚ÄòInverter Man of India‚Äô, Sachdev was the first entrepreneur to file patents for technology and design in the Indian power backup industry. He is also credited with inventing world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter which has been declared as ‚ÄòInnovation of the Decade‚Äô.\n\nKunwer revolutionised the power back-up industry by introducing world-class technologies such as MOSFET, Micro controller based and DSP Sine Wave into inverters. He also gave ‚ÄòHome UPS‚Äô to India which combined the features of UPS and inverter into single equipment.\n\nAnas Rahman Junaid, Managing Director and Chief Researcher of Hurun Report India said, ‚ÄúChina and India are the two economies that will lead the world in the next 10 to 20 years. Hurun has been in China for the last 20 years and we have seen how the Chinese entrepreneurs have grown and come of age. We do see a similar pattern in India. So, this award is really about how we are going to achieve that kind of growth story in India. By identifying the patterns in China, we look at those entrepreneurs in India who have contributed in a similar fashion.‚Äù\n\nHailing from a lower middle-class family background, Sachdev never let financial constraints bar him from becoming a serial entrepreneur. He started off by selling pens on cycle with his older brother at a tender age of 15 years. He later founded a profitable business of cable TV communications in Delhi.\n\nBeing a visionary, Kunwer was quick to foresee the growth of power backup industry in India and decided to shut down his cable TV business in 1998 to establish Su-Kam Power Systems which is headquartered in Gurgaon.\n\nSachdev is credited with catapulting Su-Kam to the top league of companies in its category within a short span of a few years. Once a startup, Su-Kam, is now an Indian Multinational Corporation, and is recognised as one of the fastest growing organisation among the India Inc. 500.\n\nToday Su-Kam manufactures more than 250 products including various solar products, UPS, batteries, and customized solar solutions. A successful example of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, Su-Kam has over 75,000 channel partners in many countries around the world. Sachdev has been instrumental in expanding company‚Äôs operations to almost 90 countries worldwide and capturing the power market in Africa and Asia.

    "snippet": "But, Kunwer Sachdev, the erstwhile cable guy, is not as comfortable as you would think. \"I am very excited about this new technology I discovered at the GITEX fair 2006.",
    "content": "KUNWER SACHDEV, 40 Education : Statistics (Hons), Hindu College\n\nWorked with : A telecom company\n\nLast salaried job : Rs 8,000 a month\n\nAge at starting business : 23 years\n\nNo. of years as entrepreneur : 17 years\n\nInitial investment : Rs 10,000\n\nSources of fund : Personal savings\n\nCompany : Su-kam Power Systems,manufacturers\n\nof power protection devices\n\nTurnover : Rs 200 crore in 2005-6\n\nNo of employees : 1,000\n\nWho would look twice at the guy who came to fix the cable for your new TV? Leave alone think that he had a great career prospect? But this cable guy, who had just left a sales executive job, had stars in his eyes. Stars that would eventually light up millions, of homes during the inevitable power failures. And from working the pliers in apartment after apartment in Delhi, he now sits comfortable at the helm of one of the biggest inverter manufacturing company of the country, Su-kam.\n\nBut, Kunwer Sachdev, the erstwhile cable guy, is not as comfortable as you would think. \"I am very excited about this new technology I discovered at the GITEX fair 2006. In business you have to constantly upgrade. If you want to move forward, you just can't stagnate.\" Sachdev would know. Creating a Rs 200- crore company from zilch with no formal training in engineering or management, is no mean achievement. He didn't even start with inverters, but cabling equipment. And it isn't as if lady luck really pursued him. It took Sachdev a patient 17 years to set up this enterprise which now has 20% equity stake from Reliance India Power Fund, a private equity fund sponsored jointly by Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Singapore-based Temasek Holdings.\n\nFor a graduate in statistics to a \"business technologist\" is surely an unusual leap. \"But business was always on my mind. All through college I thought of nothing else,\" confesses Sachdev. It may be that repeated failures of his father, a railway clerk, to start his own business, silently motivated the son to accomplish what his father couldn't. \"One lesson I learnt from my father's failure was that career and business don't go together. You have to sacrifice one for the other,\" says Sachdev. And failure has been the cornerstone of every success that he has known. During college, he helped his elder brother establish a business of pens. But they fell out, and Sachdev was on his own. The sales executive's job with a telecom company followed. In 1987 he married Gita, his junior at Delhi's Hindu College, amidst parental opposition. Sachdev moved to a rented\n\nhouse. Gita's teaching job in a school came in handy.\n\nWhat Sachdev learnt about the telecom company stoked his business instincts. By 1989 he was ready to start a cable TV business with the help of a techie from the same company. An investment of Rs 10,000 was enough to get the system going. But while Sachdev quit his job, the techie refused, and for a while the father's story of failure became the son's. Sachdev did not give up hope.\n\nThe going became tougher as it was now a one-man-show- human resources, finance, technology et al. \"To get the work going I took up small assignments of cabling work for multi-storeyed buildings and hotels with two workers,\" says Sachdev, who managed these odd jobs with the advance payments from clients. Gita turned out to be his bedrock of support during the tough times. She would not only manage the house and their first-born but also slip a few notes of encouragement into Sachdev's pockets from time to time.\n\nSachdev's Tips for Aspiring Start-ups BE HONEST WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nIf your product is faulty replace it, that is the best way to win over the customer\n\nREINVEST IN YOUR BUSINESS\n\nInstead of investing in real estate or stocks, Sachdev reinvests in his business\n\nINVEST IN EMPLOYEES\n\nSu-kam organises annual get to gethers for employees\n\nQUICK DECISIONS\n\nSachdev is known for his 'lightning speed' decision-making skill\n\nTHINK AHEAD\n\nDon't gloat over your achievements. Plan your next move\n\nWhen his friend left him, perhaps the biggest handicap was his complete ignorance of the technology field. So Sachdev decided to learn it on the job. Business and learning went together as he laboured on.The first taste of success came in 1991 when the business of cable TV witnessed a boom with the introduction of multi-channels. Each house needed cabling and Sachdev cashed in on this boom. He set up a small-scale unit with six people to manufacture amplifiers and directral couplers - all needed in the business of cablingunder the brand name Su-kam.\n\n\"The demand was huge, players were few and we were quality conscious. We would take back all faulty products thus reinforcing the faith of our customers,\" says Sachdev, who soon expanded his business by manufacturing dish antennas and satellite receivers. \"By 1997 our products were being sold in entire north India,\" says Sachdev. He had made his first million.\n\nIt seems that destiny finally decided to intervene and do a little jig of her own that would spell much bigger success. It was sometime in 1997 when Sachdev's home inverter conked off for the nth time. Frustrated, he decided to take it apart himself to identify the problem. What he saw was not a flawed product but immense business potential in giving the consumer something superior. Once the idea was born, Sachdev was quick to cash in on it. Intensive studies followed and using a new (Mosfet) technology he started manufacturing inverters at his factory.\n\nBut wait, even here destiny did not play it straight. The products were a disaster and all 100 of them were returned by the buyers. Not to be bogged down by yet another failure, Sachdev got a few people from the fledgling UPS industry and focused on technological innovation. He manufactured inverters using a more advanced technology testing and retesting them for failures. The capacity was just enough to manufacture 100 inverters a month but the response for the refined inverters was stupendous. In the unorganised market, his products stood out.\n\nIn 2000, Sachdev took the decision to close down his profitable business of cable TV products and set up his first big factory in Gurgaon at a cost of Rs 15 lakh. His quest to continuously upgrade his products using new technologies made him a clear market leader. A validation of his success came when heavyweights Reliance and Temasek paid Rs 45 crore for a 20% stake in the company. Sachdev is now looking at other futuristic areas such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems, hybrid systems and inverters of over 100 kva capacity. A Rs 80-crore factory to manufacture SMF batteries will be operational in April 2007.\n\nTime to go public? Maybe, he says. For a man, who took up a few insurance policies only because the agents were persistent, matters of personal finance do not rank rather high on his priority table. \"I would rather re-invest in business than purchase property, look up the stock market or mutual funds,\" he says. Perhaps a house in Gurgaon, a farmhouse, 21 offices, three factories and 1,000 employees, are enough for Sachdev to be unconcerned with personal finance."

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up.
