    "content": "Kunwer Sachdev\n\nMy journey as an entrepreneur has been anything but ordinary. I never set out to build a multi-million-dollar company, nor did I have a blueprint for success. What I had was an insatiable curiosity, an unyielding determination, and the belief that problems exist only to be solved. Even at the age of 15, I started selling pens to shopkeepers with my brother, which gave me my first experience of sales, a skill that proved invaluable throughout my career.https://kunwersachdev.com/mr-kunwer-sachdev-the-inverter-man-of-india-journey/\n\nI started my career in theCable TV business, learning the ropes of entrepreneurship through sheer experience. I had no formal education in technology or business, yet I was fascinated by how things worked‚Äîhow signals were transmitted, how machines functioned, how innovation could change lives. This curiosity became my biggest strength.\n\nIt was this same curiosity that led me to the world of power backup solutions. In the early days, people in India struggled withfrequent power cuts.Inverters and batteries were unreliable, inefficient, and often made with outdated technology. I saw a gap, an opportunity to create something better. With no background in electronics, I immersed myself in learning, experimenting, and innovating, and that‚Äôs howSu-Kam was born.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam was not easy. There were challenges at every step‚Äîfrom R&D and manufacturing to sales and service. But I believed in the power of perseverance and innovation. We introduced India‚Äôs first MOSFET-based inverter, India‚Äôs first DSP-based inverter, and many other groundbreaking technologies that changed the face of the industry.Su-Kam became more than just a company; it became a revolution. We not only built inverters, UPS systems, and solar solutions but also trained thousands of professionals, setting industry benchmarks.\n\nHowever, life has its twists and turns. Despite all the success, I had to step away from Su-Kam. But true passion never fades, and for me, innovation is not just about business‚Äîit is about making a difference. I knew my journey wasn‚Äôt over. That‚Äôs whenSu-vastika was born.\n\nWith Su-vastika, my vision is even larger. The world is moving towardssustainable energy, smart power backup solutions, and advanced energy storage systems. I am now focusing on creating patented technologies that will shape the future of power solutions‚Äîsolutions that are not just reliable and efficient but also environmentally friendly and future-ready.\n\nToday, Su-vastika is leading the way in Lithium Battery Energy Storage, Solar Energy Innovations, and Automatic Power Backup Systems. We are not just creating products; we are building an ecosystem of knowledge, innovation, and global impact.The AI is the new mantra for products, and we are building AI into each product to make them smart.\n\nOutside of work, I find inspiration and balance in my personal passions‚Äîswimming clears my mind, whistling lifts my spirit, trekking fuels my adventurous side,Yoga keeps me fit and reading keeps my mind sharpand ever-curious. These interests aren‚Äôt just hobbies; they‚Äôre a reflection of the same passion, discipline, and love for exploration that I bring into my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIf my journey has taught me anything, it is thatsuccess is not about what you achieve‚Äîit‚Äôs about the challenges you overcome, the knowledge you share, and the legacy you leave behind.Through Su-vastika, I want to continue pushing the boundaries of technology, inspiring the next generation of innovators, and proving that with determination, India can lead the world in power solutions.\n\nThe journey is far from over.

Known as ‚ÄúThe Inverter Man of India‚Äù and now fondly called ‚ÄúThe Solar Man of India,‚Äù Kunwer is a man who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against him‚Äîand turned that dream into light for millions.\n\nA Spark Ignited Early\n\nKunwer Sachdev was born in a modest home in Delhi, where power cuts were a part of daily life. He wasn‚Äôt born into privilege, nor did he carry a degree from a fancy business school. What he had, however, was far more powerful‚Äîcuriosity, courage, and clarity of purpose. He could see what others overlooked: the quiet suffering of families left in the dark and businesses crippled by unreliable electricity.\n\nWhile others adapted to the darkness, Kunwer chose to challenge it.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam: Lighting Up Lives\n\nIn 1988, with more grit than capital, Kunwer founded Su-Kam Power Systems. He didn‚Äôt just want to build a company‚Äîhe wanted to solve a national problem. From inventing the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter to creating the iconic Home UPS, he turned Su-Kam into a beacon of innovation.\n\nUnder his leadership, Su-Kam wasn‚Äôt just a business‚Äîit was a movement. A movement that brought power, dignity, and stability to homes and villages across India. The company grew from a small setup to a global brand operating in over 90 countries, winning hearts and awards along the way.\n\nBut behind every product was a purpose. And behind every success, a sleepless night of hard work.\n\nA Story Worth Telling\n\nThe world took notice of this self-made man with a mission. Kunwer‚Äôs journey has been chronicled in some of India‚Äôs most inspiring books:\n\n- Booming Brands by Harsh Pamnani ‚Äì capturing how he built Su-Kam into a trusted name from scratch.- Making Breakthrough Innovations Happen by Porus Munshi ‚Äì highlighting his passion for solving India's energy crisis through bold, scalable ideas.- Connect the Dots by Rashmi Bansal ‚Äì showcasing Kunwer as the everyday hero who built an empire without an MBA, but with the school of life as his teacher.\n\nEach page is a tribute to his belief: Innovation is for everyone. Especially the ones who need it most.\n\nReinventing for Tomorrow: Su-vastika & Kunwwer.ai\n\nEven after building one of India‚Äôs most successful power brands, Kunwer didn‚Äôt stop. His heart still beats for the future‚Äîand for those who need it the most.\n\nWith Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., he‚Äôs now tackling the next frontier: energy storage. Through lithium-ion batteries and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), he‚Äôs helping India move towards a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAnd now, with Kunwwer.ai, he‚Äôs stepping into the world of artificial intelligence‚Äîyet again ahead of the curve. His vision: to democratize innovation, using AI to bring smart solutions to energy, education, and business.\n\nMore Than an Entrepreneur\n\nKunwer Sachdev is more than just a successful businessman. He is a mentor, a dreamer, a changemaker. He believes that true success lies not in wealth, but in impact‚Äîin the number of lives touched, the villages lit up, the hope restored.\n\nWords to Live By\n\n‚ÄúIf your innovation solves a real problem, success will chase you.

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India‚Äôs power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected. Despite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev‚Äôs legacy alive in the power backup industry.https://kunwersachdev.com/the-story-of-inverter-man-of-india-resilience-and-rebuilding\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: It is important to note that while Mr. Kunwer Sachdev founded Su-Kam Power Systems, he is no longer associated with the company as of 2019.

    "content": "Kunwer Sachdev\n\nMy journey as an entrepreneur has been anything but ordinary. I never set out to build a multi-million-dollar company, nor did I have a blueprint for success. What I had was an insatiable curiosity, an unyielding determination, and the belief that problems exist only to be solved. Even at the age of 15, I started selling pens to shopkeepers with my brother, which gave me my first experience of sales, a skill that proved invaluable throughout my career.https://kunwersachdev.com/mr-kunwer-sachdev-the-inverter-man-of-india-journey/\n\nI started my career in theCable TV business, learning the ropes of entrepreneurship through sheer experience. I had no formal education in technology or business, yet I was fascinated by how things worked‚Äîhow signals were transmitted, how machines functioned, how innovation could change lives. This curiosity became my biggest strength.\n\nIt was this same curiosity that led me to the world of power backup solutions. In the early days, people in India struggled withfrequent power cuts.Inverters and batteries were unreliable, inefficient, and often made with outdated technology. I saw a gap, an opportunity to create something better. With no background in electronics, I immersed myself in learning, experimenting, and innovating, and that‚Äôs howSu-Kam was born.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam was not easy. There were challenges at every step‚Äîfrom R&D and manufacturing to sales and service. But I believed in the power of perseverance and innovation. We introduced India‚Äôs first MOSFET-based inverter, India‚Äôs first DSP-based inverter, and many other groundbreaking technologies that changed the face of the industry.Su-Kam became more than just a company; it became a revolution. We not only built inverters, UPS systems, and solar solutions but also trained thousands of professionals, setting industry benchmarks.\n\nHowever, life has its twists and turns. Despite all the success, I had to step away from Su-Kam. But true passion never fades, and for me, innovation is not just about business‚Äîit is about making a difference. I knew my journey wasn‚Äôt over. That‚Äôs whenSu-vastika was born.\n\nWith Su-vastika, my vision is even larger. The world is moving towardssustainable energy, smart power backup solutions, and advanced energy storage systems. I am now focusing on creating patented technologies that will shape the future of power solutions‚Äîsolutions that are not just reliable and efficient but also environmentally friendly and future-ready.\n\nToday, Su-vastika is leading the way in Lithium Battery Energy Storage, Solar Energy Innovations, and Automatic Power Backup Systems. We are not just creating products; we are building an ecosystem of knowledge, innovation, and global impact.The AI is the new mantra for products, and we are building AI into each product to make them smart.\n\nOutside of work, I find inspiration and balance in my personal passions‚Äîswimming clears my mind, whistling lifts my spirit, trekking fuels my adventurous side,Yoga keeps me fit and reading keeps my mind sharpand ever-curious. These interests aren‚Äôt just hobbies; they‚Äôre a reflection of the same passion, discipline, and love for exploration that I bring into my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIf my journey has taught me anything, it is thatsuccess is not about what you achieve‚Äîit‚Äôs about the challenges you overcome, the knowledge you share, and the legacy you leave behind.Through Su-vastika, I want to continue pushing the boundaries of technology, inspiring the next generation of innovators, and proving that with determination, India can lead the world in power solutions.\n\nThe journey is far from over.

Known as ‚ÄúThe Inverter Man of India‚Äù and now fondly called ‚ÄúThe Solar Man of India,‚Äù Kunwer is a man who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against him‚Äîand turned that dream into light for millions.\n\nA Spark Ignited Early\n\nKunwer Sachdev was born in a modest home in Delhi, where power cuts were a part of daily life. He wasn‚Äôt born into privilege, nor did he carry a degree from a fancy business school. What he had, however, was far more powerful‚Äîcuriosity, courage, and clarity of purpose. He could see what others overlooked: the quiet suffering of families left in the dark and businesses crippled by unreliable electricity.\n\nWhile others adapted to the darkness, Kunwer chose to challenge it.\n\nBuilding Su-Kam: Lighting Up Lives\n\nIn 1988, with more grit than capital, Kunwer founded Su-Kam Power Systems. He didn‚Äôt just want to build a company‚Äîhe wanted to solve a national problem. From inventing the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter to creating the iconic Home UPS, he turned Su-Kam into a beacon of innovation.\n\nUnder his leadership, Su-Kam wasn‚Äôt just a business‚Äîit was a movement. A movement that brought power, dignity, and stability to homes and villages across India. The company grew from a small setup to a global brand operating in over 90 countries, winning hearts and awards along the way.\n\nBut behind every product was a purpose. And behind every success, a sleepless night of hard work.\n\nA Story Worth Telling\n\nThe world took notice of this self-made man with a mission. Kunwer‚Äôs journey has been chronicled in some of India‚Äôs most inspiring books:\n\n- Booming Brands by Harsh Pamnani ‚Äì capturing how he built Su-Kam into a trusted name from scratch.- Making Breakthrough Innovations Happen by Porus Munshi ‚Äì highlighting his passion for solving India's energy crisis through bold, scalable ideas.- Connect the Dots by Rashmi Bansal ‚Äì showcasing Kunwer as the everyday hero who built an empire without an MBA, but with the school of life as his teacher.\n\nEach page is a tribute to his belief: Innovation is for everyone. Especially the ones who need it most.\n\nReinventing for Tomorrow: Su-vastika & Kunwwer.ai\n\nEven after building one of India‚Äôs most successful power brands, Kunwer didn‚Äôt stop. His heart still beats for the future‚Äîand for those who need it the most.\n\nWith Su-vastika Systems Pvt. Ltd., he‚Äôs now tackling the next frontier: energy storage. Through lithium-ion batteries and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), he‚Äôs helping India move towards a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAnd now, with Kunwwer.ai, he‚Äôs stepping into the world of artificial intelligence‚Äîyet again ahead of the curve. His vision: to democratize innovation, using AI to bring smart solutions to energy, education, and business.\n\nMore Than an Entrepreneur\n\nKunwer Sachdev is more than just a successful businessman. He is a mentor, a dreamer, a changemaker. He believes that true success lies not in wealth, but in impact‚Äîin the number of lives touched, the villages lit up, the hope restored.\n\nWords to Live By\n\n‚ÄúIf your innovation solves a real problem, success will chase you.

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience.

  "content": "A Staggering Beginning...\nKunwar had an annual turnover of Rs 3-4 crores and handsome profits. But many big players had entered the field and demand for his product was declining.\nIn 1998, he thought of getting into inverters. Kunwar noticed that everyone was making the same kind of inverters using a sub-standard PCB.\nKnowledge for the sake of knowledge. He learned how different things performed and showed it to his workers.\nKunwar finally managed to launch an inverter but it did not rock the market. He kept on trying and improvising.\nHe bought equipment like the power analyser and meters for testing. The company manufactured just 100 inverters in its first year of operation.\nEven though bigger manufacturers shook their heads, he was determined to make his ideas work. He wanted to make a good product ‚Äî something he was also convinced with.\nHe brought in more people with fresh ideas to work on the inverter.\n\n1989 - Kunwer joined the cable TV business. His job was to convince people to buy the cable TV system. It was a steep learning curve for him.\nHe took 4-5 orders, but due to delay on company‚Äôs part in installation, his clients were dissatisfied. This was a turning point for him.\nHe decided to learn how to install the system and took the help of his high school Physics textbooks to learn the basics.\nHe trained a boy to assist him, and together they started working on installations.\nThis installation business expanded and soon he employed 10 boys.\n\n1992 - There was a boom in the cable TV business and competition in installation increased. Kunwer decided to do something new and started his own cable TV manufacturing company.\nIt was difficult to establish this business, but by 1996‚Äì97, it flourished and he had a factory with 50 workers.\n\nTHE DIFFICULT YEARS...\nHe got offers but refused them, leading to a raid by the excise department.\nHe didn‚Äôt realise that once he became a man of status, people would be after him. This served as a good lesson for him.\nThere were many cases against him. He owed the government a lot of money.\nAll his stocks were sealed and the word spread in the market that the company was taken over.\nHe went into depression.\n\nSu-Kam developed some innovative technologies. Achieved remarkable growth due to superior products, a brand name and strong dealers.\nIn 2007, Sachdev fired some of his old employees. This further caused trouble as they began spreading rumours about the company.\nThe team made an inverter with a small circuit and one battery with much higher efficiency unlike the standard inverter.\nThey had no brand name. Su-Kam was not something people asked by name.\nKunwer contacted an advertising agency and agreed to a budget of Rs 20 lakh.\nHe himself started to learn advertising, which resulted in out-of-the-box ideas.\nThey started TV advertising ‚Äî the only inverter company to do so at the time.\nHe created 3 teams to work on putting posters all around India in dhabas and local shops.\n\nBy 2002, the company‚Äôs turnover was Rs 10 crore.\nThe following year, the company launched a sinewave inverter and an inverter with a plastic body.\n\nEarly Life & Setbacks\nHis father worked in railways but also ran businesses like grocery shops and a tailor shop ‚Äî none of which did well financially.\nThey lived in a railway colony, later moved to Punjabi Bagh.\nHe never sat idle and was always engaged in some work.\nHardships faced by the family included a meagre salary and middle-class struggles ‚Äî even affording a shirt or shoe was a big deal.\nHe shifted to a government school due to financial strain.\nAmidst parental fights and household turmoil, Kunwer became independent.\nHe was never interested in academics, and no one forced him either.\nHe enjoyed helping his brother in business and felt great earning a rupee or two.\n\nCollege & Transformation\nAn experience that changed his personality was joining Hindu College.\nComing from a Hindi medium background, he lacked confidence as everyone there spoke English.\nSomeone suggested reading novels to improve. The first book he picked was ‚ÄúThe Fountainhead‚Äù by Ayn Rand.\nIt took him a week, but he pushed through and eventually read 30 novels.\nHe became a popular student, entered politics, and joined the organizing committee for the cultural fest ‚ÄúMecca.‚Äù\n\nPersonal Life & Career Growth\nHe coined the name 'Su-Kam' for his pens and had plans to build it into a brand.\nHe had trouble adjusting with his brother who didn‚Äôt share his ambition to scale the business. Eventually, he parted ways, causing some family tension.\nAt the time, he was in a relationship with a junior from college. Pressured by her family, he took up a job and joined evening law classes.\nFor the first time, he studied seriously and became the teacher's favourite, but he never intended to practise law.\nEventually, Kunwer and Geeta eloped and started living separately from the family.\nGeeta understood their financial situation and supported the household with her job.\n\nFurther Expansion & Recognition\nHe was again approached with a buyout offer from an American MNC and also from Reliance.\nEventually, a JV between Reliance and Temasek Holdings Singapore invested Rs 45 crore in Su-Kam.\nThis was followed by a golden period of awards and accolades.\nThe Su-Kam lab became a hub for invention ‚Äî inverters running on solar power, advanced storage, and cutting-edge designs.\nNow the company has a professional CEO managing daily operations, allowing Kunwer to focus on bigger dreams."

  "date": "Sep 17, 2024",
  "content": "This case involves a petition by Mr. Kunwer Sachdev for quashing FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 of the IPC, registered at Police Station Connaught Place, New Delhi.\n\nMr. Sachdev was previously married to Ms. Geeta Sachdev and had two sons. Due to disputes, they began living separately in 2009 and later filed for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. A settlement was reached in which Mr. Sachdev agreed to pay Rs. 5 crores and transfer two properties to Ms. Geeta.\n\nTwo Addendum Agreements were signed on 11.03.2016, minutes apart. The second Addendum formed the basis of their final divorce, where the court recorded that Rs. 3 crores was the full and final settlement, and all property transfers were complete. However, Mr. Sachdev was unable to retrieve cheques issued as part of the first Addendum, which Ms. Geeta allegedly misused.\n\nSubsequently, Ms. Geeta filed multiple legal complaints including under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and a civil suit to recover Rs. 4.05 crores. The petitioner also claimed defamation due to articles in Times of India and The Hindu.\n\nMr. Sachdev asserted that the latest complaint was a misuse of legal process and that the inclusion of his second wife, Ms. Khushboo Sachdev, in the FIR was unjustified. He cited that the matter was civil in nature and not criminal. Additionally, insolvency proceedings under Section 95 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 had initiated an interim moratorium against legal actions.\n\nThe Court noted that the second Addendum was the operative and accepted document, and that any grievance related to the first Addendum is civil, not criminal. No elements of cheating or criminal breach of trust were found.\n\nTherefore, the Hon'ble Court ruled that FIR No. 0126/2024 is to be quashed, with liberty for the parties to pursue civil remedies or existing Section 138 proceedings. The judgment clarified that these observations are limited to this quashing petition and do not impact merits of civil litigation.\n\nJudge: Neena Bansal Krishna\nDate: September 17, 2024"

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience. Su-vastika now offers a range of services to dealers and customers, keeping Sachdev‚Äôs legacy alive in the power backup industry.\n\nUpdated WTC 2025-27 points table after Australia beat West Indies, Sri Lanka win series against Bangladesh; India at....\n\nMeet Parag Jain, appointed new RAW chief, who led crucial operation, including the biggest against Pakistan,¬†it¬†is...\n\nSocial worker Ritu Narang wins 'Spirit of Yoga' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nBangladesh Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto takes BIG step after losing series against Sri Lanka\n\nVersha Verma, Lucknow-based judo player and poet, wins 'Humanitarian of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n13 soldiers killed, 6 children injured in suicide bombing in Pakistan, here's what we know so far\n\nPankaj Bhadouria wins Super Chef of the Year award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nPadma Shri Dr Soniya Nityanand wins 'Light of India' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nWarren Buffett takes big decision, donates Rs 51000 crore in Berkshire Shares to..., reason is...\n\nSuparna Sarkar wins Breaking Barriers award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nViral Video: Owner of Mahindra Scorpio parks car in an unusual place, internet jokes, 'Show¬†room¬†feeling'\n\nMLC 2025: Shimron Hetmyer does THIS against Kieron Pollard on last ball during Seattle Orcas vs MI New York match\n\nTrapped in Rs 499 EMIs: The silent financial crisis of India‚Äôs young generation\n\nShah Rukh Khan's KKR star batter to join Uttar Pradesh education department, Yogi govt to give him salary of Rs..., he is...\n\nSwati Kapoor, who provides 'Thaal Sewa' to over 1200 people daily, wins 'Social Worker of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n'Kashi Ki Didi' Ranjubala Singh wins 'Warrior Spirit' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nICAI to cap individual CA annual audits to 60, from..., president says, ‚ÄòCA can also carry out...‚Äô\n\nWho is Elizabeth MacDonough?

    "content": "Kunwer Sachdev, founder and managing director, Su-Kam Power Systems Limited, has helped catapult the company from a start-up to one of the fastest growing companies in the country in a short span of time. Born in a middle-class family in Delhi, Sachdev, with no technological background, founded a company that is today known for its technologically advanced products.\n\nSachdev has a degree in mathematical statistics and law from Delhi University. In 1998, he ventured into the power backup solutions business, sett-ing up Su-Kam. Today, the company has operations across 90 countries. Prior to this, he was involved in the cable television business. Under Sachdev‚Äôs leadership, Su-Kam has achieved several firsts to its credit. It has filed over 100 patents for technology and design in the power backup industry, the highest for any Indian company. It has also launched the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter, which has been declared as the Innovation of the Decade by India Today. ‚ÄúThese innovations were possible only due to the robust research and development unit of Su-Kam. Innovation and sophistication in products is my passion,‚Äù says Sachdev.\n\nHe sees scope for major growth in the solar power space. He has led the development of innovative solar solutions ‚Äì off-grid and on-grid systems ‚Äì¬† to cater to the needs of a range of consumers.\n\nOn the state of the power sector, Sachdev says, ‚ÄúElectricity is critical to power the economic growth of the country. India is on the road to development, but to accelerate growth, it is critical to ensure the availability of uninterrupted power supply. In today‚Äôs scenario, we lack the infrastructure to meet the growing demand for power.‚Äù He further underscores the importance of renewable energy to offset the demand for conventional fuels as well as to pave the way for cleaner solutions. ‚ÄúA green economy is the need of the hour,‚Äù he says.\n\nSachdev also has a flair for marketing, which has led him to launch several innovative branding initiatives for the company. Moreover, he sees internal branding as an important strategy to engage with employees. His peers see him as a leader, who has a novel approach towards solving tough problems. He is also an ardent sports enthusiast, with swimming and running being his favourites. Going forward, Sachdev aims to make Su-Kam a market leader in technology and innovation or ‚Äútechnovation‚Äù, as he calls it.\n\n\n\nSubscribeSeptember Issue\n\nCOPYRIGHT ¬© 2017-2022  | POWER LINE\n\nGET ACCESS TO OUR ARTICLESEnter your email addressSubscribe to NewsletterPlease leave this field empty.Œî\n\n\n\nGET ACCESS TO OUR ARTICLES\n\nEnter your email address\n\n\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\n\n\nDownload Rate Card for Overseas Companies\n\nVerify Code (required)\n\nŒî\n\n\n\nDownload Rate Card for Indian Companies\n\nVerify Code (required)\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\n\n\nŒî\n\nError:Contact form not found.\n\n\n\nŒî"

  "date": "Sep 17, 2024",
  "content": "The Petition under Section 528 of BNSS, 2023 was filed by Mr. Kunwer Sachdev for quashing FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 of the IPC, registered at Police Station Connaught Place, New Delhi.\n\nMr. Sachdev was married to Ms. Geeta Sachdev on 25.09.1987 at Arya Samaj Mandir, and they have two sons. Due to irreconcilable differences, the parties have lived separately since September 2009. They jointly filed a Petition for Divorce under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, agreeing to a settlement of Rs. 5 crores and transfer of two immovable properties to Ms. Geeta.\n\nThe Settlement Deed dated 13.08.2015 was accepted, and the first motion of divorce was passed on 14.08.2015. Two Addendum Agreements were executed on 11.03.2016 ‚Äî the first stamped at 6:46 PM, the second at 6:48 PM.\n\nThe second Addendum was presented to the Court in support of the mutual divorce, confirming the full and final settlement amount as Rs. 3 crores. Based on this, the divorce was granted.\n\nMr. Sachdev claimed he was unable to retrieve cheques issued under the first Addendum, which were later deposited by Ms. Geeta. She filed a Complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and a Civil Suit seeking Rs. 4.05 crores with 12% interest.\n\nAdditionally, defamatory articles were published against him in Times of India and The Hindu. He claimed the FIR was another attempt by Ms. Geeta to harass him. She allegedly relied only on the first Addendum, ignoring the second.\n\nThe complaint also named his second wife, Khushboo Sachdev, although she had no connection to the dispute. Mr. Sachdev later paid Rs. 5,00,000 on 28.12.2022 and Rs. 2,00,000 on 21.02.2023 to avoid further conflict.\n\nDue to his insolvency proceedings under Section 95 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a moratorium under Section 96 had begun, barring legal action against him. As a result, civil proceedings by Ms. Geeta had to be halted.\n\nMr. Sachdev asserted that the FIR included unfounded allegations of breach of trust, cheating, conspiracy, and intimidation. The complaint accused him of inducing Ms. Geeta into signing settlement agreements and issuing dishonored cheques without intent to pay.\n\nFurther, he was accused of threatening her to settle for less. He contended that the complaint was based on the first Addendum alone, while the second Addendum was the final, court-approved agreement.\n\nThe respondent alleged that she believed the first Addendum was final and accused Mr. Sachdev of fraudulently presenting the second Addendum. She claimed she relied on his WhatsApp messages assuring balance payment.\n\nAfter hearing submissions, the court noted the following:\n- The parties had three settlement agreements: one in August 2015, two on 11.03.2016.\n- The second Addendum (Rs. 3 crore + 2 properties) was presented and accepted in Court during the second motion for mutual divorce.\n- Rs. 1.5 crores had been paid, Rs. 1.25 crores was deposited by bank draft, and the balance Rs. 25 lakhs was to be paid upon quashing another FIR.\n\nThe court held that:\n- The second Addendum was binding.\n- There is no evidence the second Addendum replaced the first.\n- Allegations arise from breach of civil agreement, not criminal acts.\n- There was an 8-year delay in filing the complaint.\n\nThe Court concluded that the FIR was without merit, based on civil issues, and lacked ingredients of cheating or breach of trust. Therefore:\n\nFIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 was quashed, and related proceedings were dropped. Civil and NI Act proceedings may continue. Observations in this judgment do not affect the merits of other cases.\n\nJudge: Neena Bansal Krishna\nDate: September 17, 2024"

    "content": "Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev built his company's fortune by cashing in on an unreliable power grid. Now, he's looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit\n\nWhen he turned 15, Kunwer Sachdev began helping his older brother sell pens to shops in Delhi. It was the late 1970s, and the nation‚Äôs capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India‚Äôs largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices‚Äîwhich he didn‚Äôt have access to when he was growing up‚Äîthat provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.Power outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world‚Äôs population, don‚Äôt have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.These days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs promise of replicating Gujarat‚Äôs 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It‚Äôs also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit.Su-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.‚ÄúWe started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don‚Äôt have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I‚Äôm already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,‚Äù says Sachdev.He may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. ‚ÄúWe started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,‚Äù he says.Su-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.Su-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.At the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚ÄùA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines.Subscribe Now(This story appears in the 12 December, 2014 issue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Forbes India.

Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.\n\nSu-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology. Foreign companies have to buy Indian technology even if they want to expand to Africa,‚Äù he says.At the same time, he accuses local rivals of copying his products and laments India‚Äôs slow patent regime for allowing it. ‚ÄúWe have filed the highest number of patents in the world in our industry, but yesterday I wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi asking how he would implement his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan if it takes seven to eight years to grant a patent.‚ÄùA valid concern given that Sachdev is hoping to make hay while the sun shines.Subscribe Now(This story appears in the 12 December, 2014 issue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof Forbes India.

    "content": "Founder & CEO of Su-Kam Power Systems\n\nFebruary 11, 2015 6:12 am/2 Commentson ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù to reduce India‚Äôs electronics import¬†bill\n\nMake in Indiais the biggest initiative launched by our Prime Minister to attract investors to our country and to encourage them to manufacture in India. This one campaign will provide the much needed boost to India‚Äôs economy by creating jobs, making India a self reliant economy and getting the country its rightful place under the sun. The Prime Minister has also set very high targets for the focus sectors.\n\n\n\nMrKunwer Sachdeva, Managing Director Su-Kam Power Systems, while speaking to a team fromIndia Infoline(IIFL) lauded the Prime Minister‚Äôs initiative, especially in the Solar Sector. Under the National Solar Mission, the Prime Minister has enhanced the goal from 20 GW of solar energy by 2020 to 100 GW, a huge step. Mr Sachdev believes that this target though achievable would require a slew of investors, manufacturers, and other involvement of many stakeholders.\n\nThe Inverter Man of India is very upbeat about India‚Äôs performance based on the steps taken byNarendra Modi. A number of new technologies are being developed in India. Su-Kam well symbolises Make in India ‚Äì for over 15 years now the company has been innovating and manufacturing in India. The company holds close to 100 design patents in India, USA and other countries, and over 100 technology patents. Today the company files a minimum of 30 patents a year. However, Mr Sachdeva believes that the Patent granting system in the country leaves a lot to be desired. The patents that Su-Kam has filed for over six years ago are yet to be granted. In today‚Äôs dynamic world technology changes very fast and some of these have already become obsolete.\n\nThis needs to be fixed very quickly. Having said that there is no doubt that the Make in India initiative will ensure that a large number of companies start manufacturing in India, thus generating employment and improving the standard of living in the country.\n\n\n\nMr Sachdeva also believes that this initiative can have a major impact at India‚Äôs macro-economic picture. For instance, if we were to only focus on the electronics industry, there is much that can be achieved. According to industry experts, India‚Äôs electronic imports may surpass its oil import bill by 2030. Keeping the current oil prices in view, this aim may also be achieved by 2025. Currently the annual imports stand at over USD 35 billion!\n\nFirm laws and a fast paced administrative machinery are critical to the success of the Make in India campaign, said Mr Kunwer Sachdev while speaking to the IIFL team.\n\nJanuary 12, 2015 6:00 am/16 Commentson Inverter Man of India ‚Äì Always a Step¬†Ahead!\n\n\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev has been aptly given the title of the ‚ÄúInverter Man of India‚Äù. Frustrated over a malfunctioning inverter at his house he opened the inverter and studied the reasons for its continuous failure. Little did he know then that he was taking the first step toward revolutionising an industry that was highly unorganised.\n\n\n\nWhen he opened that inverter,Kunwer Sachdevaalso did not realise that with that one action he was about to script his life‚Äôs story of rags to riches. Mr Sachdev hails from a very humble background and spent his early career selling pens. He faced numerous challenges at every step, however he never deterred, building his company from strength to strength. He always searched for an opportunity when faced with a problem, rather than giving up he tried to find a solution and move ahead.\n\nThoughKunwer Sachdevhad no formal training in electronics or an engineering degree, he built a power backup solutions company known globally for products backed by world class technology. Mr Sachdeva‚Äôs vision, entrepreneurial capability and determination led him to build Su-Kam into a Superbrand.\n\nAn innovation driven company, Su-Kam is always a step ahead of the industry.Kunwer Sachdeva, who built Su-Kam into a Rs 1000 crore plus company realised early on that Solar is the answer to India‚Äôs growing power needs. Su-Kam has a very strong R&D which is constantly working on developing innovative solar solutions. That day is perhaps not far when the Inverter Man of India will get renamed as the Solar Man of India.\n\nNovember 28, 2014 11:08 am/27 Commentson The Inverter Man of India runs the Airtel Half¬†Marathon\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdev, also known as the Inverter Man of India, ran the Airtel Half Marathon on November 23, 2014 in Delhi. Achieving a time of 2hrs 21 mins, he ran 21 kms. Mr Sachdev is an avid sports person and a swimmer. He found the time to run the marathon despite his busy schedule, as he was determined to do so this year.Mr Kunwer Sachdeva believes in the saying ‚Äú‚ÄùFinishing a marathon is a state of mind that says ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE‚Äù. Running the marathon has been just that for him ‚Äì breaking a mental barrier that it is difficult to run 21 kms at a stretch.\n\n\n\nMr Kunwer Sachdeva has lived his life by the saying ‚ÄúAnything is Possible‚Äù ‚Äì overcoming challenges and proving it right over and over again. Coming from a very humble background, Mr Kunwer Sachdeva has built a Rs. 1200 crore company. Though academically he is not a technical person, he is credited with transforming the inverter industry from a non-technical industry into a highly technologically advanced industry!\n\nEven after running the half marathon, Mr Sachdeva‚Äôs batteries were as charged as those manufactured by his company. Ask him where he gets this energy from, and he says it is his determination and grit to achieve the impossible and break barriers that drive him. This is why he emerges victorious over and over again.\n\nJune 9, 2014 7:01 am/Leave a comment\n\nIndiaMART & ET NOW joined hands to present ‚ÄòIndiaMART Leaders of Tomorrow Awards‚Äô to recognise the contribution of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in driving India‚Äôs march to global stardom. The mission of the awards was to acknowledge the importance of SMEs in increasing trade, generating employment & creating new entrepreneurs in India,along with a commitment to develop a strong SME eco-system.\n\nIndia mart & ET Now invites Mr. Kunwer Sachdev\n\nThe finale of the award ceremony was organized in The Oberoi, New Delhi, and the chief guest being Mr. K. V. Kamath, non-executive chairman ICICI BANK.\n\nMr. Kunwer Sachdevwas invited as a special guest since he in the earlier years had been a part of the SME‚Äôs and successfully led Su-Kam out of the category into large scale eneterprises.

One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality. Entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev, located in Gurugram, has been listed as one of 2017's 6th Huron's Most Respected Entrepreneurs.\n\nHe has won numerous honors as a result of industrialist, technology, and invention. It mostly consists of the \"Bharat Shiromani\" award given by the Indian government and the Ernst & Young \"Best Industrialist of the Year\" honor. ¬†Kunwar Sachdev's biography, it is clear that talent alone may make a person successful without needing a degree as you know that despite being successful, Bill Gates and Facebook are former students of Mark Zuckerberg College.\n\n\n\nRead More News :\n\nStepping out of the Domestic Threshold, becoming the Richest Mother\n\nIndia's retail king, Radhakishan Damani\n\n¬© 2025 siliconindia.com All rights reserved.Attorneys Near Me|Attorneys"

Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.\n\nTrending Photos\n\nSuccess Story:The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.Kunwer Sachdev: Rags To RichesA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.Su-Kam- The Unmatched ProductHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes.

Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family.

    "content": "The introduction of electricity transformed the way our lives for decades, but the growing numbers of shortages and their lengthening frequency made the power backup industry necessary. Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India. The company is one of the most rapidly growing and progressive businesses in the country. Sachdev has been an inspiration to many who have proven that dreams do come true if we put in our dedication and hard work with the right energy.\n\nKunwer Sachdev was raised in the family of a railway clerk in Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh neighbourhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, he started working in his brother‚Äôs pen business. Due to continuous power outrage, he quickly understood that there was a huge potential in the field of power backup. With the challenges of a severe power deficit, he decided to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer had a difficult time bringing investment for his business but it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to some issues. He then improved them and made them better than the ones available in the market. After much research, he approached dealers and wholesalers. Even though the market was already crowded with various brands Su-kam‚Äôs inverters were unmatched in terms of price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam became the first company in the power industry which initiated exporting its products to the international markets.\n\nHe envisioned a Make in India campaign and his company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. He has also captured the markets in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa and Nepal where his products were valued for their quality and reliability.\n\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n\nKunwer expanded Su-Kam and made the brand widely known for its proficiency in the solar energy industry. However, due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam went into bankruptcy. Its assets were also frozen. All the services were closed instantly. Due to this, dealers, distributors and customers suffered due to lack of services.\n\nAfter so many hurdles, his wife Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help give services to the customers.  Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev with the help of her friends and distributors. The company has been able to give several services to dealers, distributors and customers. Now, the company will be filing for over 60 patents with 6 under their name.\n\nLatest Blogs"

    "content": "BUSINESS\n\nKunwar Sachdev is the man who once sold pens door-to-door and worked as a marketer to fund his education before founding a company worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nRitik Raj\n\nUpdated :Feb 08, 2024, 10:09 AM IST| Edited by :Ritik Raj\n\nSetting goals and achieving goals are two different things because winners and losers have the same goals, but most fail and few win. Kunwar Sachdev is one such example of achieving his goal. The saying \"one thought changes your entire life\" is often heard but rarely demonstrated. Kunwar Sachdev, for example, used to make a little money by selling pens door to door. One day, however, he had an idea and decided to invest some money to launch a successful business that is now operating not just in India but also in many other countries.\n\nGrowing up in the family of a railway clerk, Kunwer Sachdev is a dreamer who has become a great inspiration in India's power backup industry. His path, characterized by inventiveness and perseverance, demonstrates the transforming potential of commitment. Kunwar had raised the money for his education by going door-to-door to sell pens. He had given up on his dream of becoming a doctor since he could not get medical admission.\n\nWhile working in marketing for a cable company after graduating, Kunwar Sachdev learned that the industry has a lot of room to grow and that not all challenges must be overcome from the start. He just quit his job and founded Su-Kam Communication, which subsequently concentrated solely on producing solar-related products.\n\nThe company owned by Kunwar Sachdev manufactures a variety of solar products that are in high demand in India and abroad. Kunwar Sachdev reportedly owns businesses worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nUpdated WTC 2025-27 points table after Australia beat West Indies, Sri Lanka win series against Bangladesh; India at....\n\nMeet Parag Jain, appointed new RAW chief, who led crucial operation, including the biggest against Pakistan,¬†it¬†is...\n\nSocial worker Ritu Narang wins 'Spirit of Yoga' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nBangladesh Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto takes BIG step after losing series against Sri Lanka\n\nVersha Verma, Lucknow-based judo player and poet, wins 'Humanitarian of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n13 soldiers killed, 6 children injured in suicide bombing in Pakistan, here's what we know so far\n\nPankaj Bhadouria wins Super Chef of the Year award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nPadma Shri Dr Soniya Nityanand wins 'Light of India' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nWarren Buffett takes big decision, donates Rs 51000 crore in Berkshire Shares to..., reason is...\n\nSuparna Sarkar wins Breaking Barriers award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nViral Video: Owner of Mahindra Scorpio parks car in an unusual place, internet jokes, 'Show¬†room¬†feeling'\n\nMLC 2025: Shimron Hetmyer does THIS against Kieron Pollard on last ball during Seattle Orcas vs MI New York match\n\nTrapped in Rs 499 EMIs: The silent financial crisis of India‚Äôs young generation\n\nShah Rukh Khan's KKR star batter to join Uttar Pradesh education department, Yogi govt to give him salary of Rs..., he is...\n\nSwati Kapoor, who provides 'Thaal Sewa' to over 1200 people daily, wins 'Social Worker of the Year' at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\n'Kashi Ki Didi' Ranjubala Singh wins 'Warrior Spirit' award at DNA Women Achievers Awards 2025\n\nICAI to cap individual CA annual audits to 60, from..., president says, ‚ÄòCA can also carry out...‚Äô\n\nWho is Elizabeth MacDonough?

    "content": "Solar Man Of India:One of the finest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary businessmen of our time is Kunwer Sachdev, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's premier provider of power solutions. Kunwer Sachdev, like Thomas Edison, has cemented his place in history by founding one of the most admired Indian businesses and revolutionizing the power backup sector.\n\nTrending Photos\n\nSuccess Story:The introduction of electricity transformed our way of life for decades, but the growing number of shortages and their lengthening frequency have made another invention necessary. Behind the scenes, a game changer with a non-technical background was putting in his hard work and commitment as this awful state of electricity deficit persisted for years. Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India and the brains behind Su-Kam, one of the most progressive and rapidly expanding businesses in the country.Kunwer Sachdev: Rags To RichesA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day. Following his graduation from college in 1984, he started working full-time in his brother's pen business. He attended a public school where the curriculum was taught in Hindi. He quickly recognized the potential in the field of power backup because he was a visionary from an early age. Due to the challenges of a severe power deficit, he made the decision to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998. He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.Su-Kam- The Unmatched ProductHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did. And he is not done yet.\n\nA real \"rags to riches\" story, Kunwer Sachdev was raised by a railway clerk in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh neighborhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.

He has since launched numerous additional enterprises, but he has maintained the same Su-Kam throughout his entrepreneurial career for all of his ventures. But where did the name Su-Kam originate? The initials of his daughter's name, his name, and the names of his future children were once combined in Kunwer's mind to form the name of his company.Su-Kam- The Unmatched ProductHe had a difficult time raising money for his business, so it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to issues. Never one to give up, he improved his invention and fixed all the flaws to make it better than anything else on the market. Before making cold calls to prospective new clients, he first spoke with a number of his cable TV clients. Realizing that selling to people directly would not help him grow his business, he started approaching dealers and wholesalers. The majority of producers quickly realized that Su-Kam was unmatched in terms of product quality and price, even though the market was already crowded at the time.Su-Kam: MonopolyThey were therefore compelled to accept Kunwer's proposals in order to become his company's initial partner. Soon after, Su-Kam became the first company in the industry to start exporting its products to the aforementioned markets. Kunwer started expanding his business during this time by visiting other nations. Kunwer surmounted new barriers brought on by governmental restrictions, corporate traditions, legal frameworks, and rivalries to establish Su-Kam as a household name in many of these countries. For his achievements, Kunwer Sachdev was given various awards, including the \"Bharat Shiromani\" and the Ernst and Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" titles.Su-Kam BankruptcySu-Kam Power Systems Limited filed for bankruptcy as a result of a string of tragic events, and Kunwer Sachdev was forced to quit the company he had considered his own for 32 years of his career and distance himself from it after getting involved in various legal disputes. The man who altered the landscape of India's power backup industry was forced to fight his toughest battle. The business was closed for two years (April 2019-April 2022). There was no help available. Nobody was answering the phone calls or responding to emails. Dealers and customers both suffered greatly during this time.Khushboo Sachdev: A Blessing In DisguiseCustomers, distributors, suppliers, and other company associates were left with a void following Kunwer Sachdev's departure from the business that he started and oversaw from its beginning until 2018. Customers and dealers both suffered because they had unsold goods and services on their hands, and there was no way to resolve any warranty claims from customers. After great effort and difficulty, Kunwer Sachdev's wife, Khushboo Sachdev, stepped up to assist him in these circumstances.Su-Vastika And The Power WomanUnder the guidance of Kunwer Sachdev, Khushboo Sachdev launched a new business called Su-vastika with a lot of assistance and support from friends and family. She created this new company with financial assistance from Kunwer's friends and family despite having no prior experience in business management. Her own struggles compelled her to do so, and there was no turning back after that. She met people, made plans, and was aware of every step. Although she was inexperienced, she started Su-vastika with a team thanks to her tenacity and enthusiasm. She made do with her children and elevated Su-vastika.The brand experience, according to Kunwer, begins inward and moves outward from there. It is for this reason that, on the one hand, he provided fresh challenges for his employees to advance their abilities. On the other hand, he observed all the holidays with fervor and took several steps to strengthen the bonds among his team members. The establishment of one of the most admired Indian firms, which revolutionized the power backup market, has earned Kunwer Sachdev his place in history, just like Thomas Edison did.

    "content": "By Srabani Sen\n\n‚Ä¶Su-Kam‚Äîthe name was suddenly decided at the college canteen. Not for my inverter company but for my pen business, as in those days I was only familiar with this business while I assisted my elder brother sell pens on the roads of Delhi,‚Äù Sachdev starts off to narrate his story, while he lounges casually and relishes his ‚Äòfruitful‚Äô salad for breakfast. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm conscious about what I eat, so I start my day with fruits to remove the toxics from my body.‚Äù\n\nTaking a generous bite, Sachdev continues, ‚ÄúMy story can inspire people to think big. They will realise that anything is possible in life and it is they who can change their own lives. How? If you have the passion, focus and the zeal to grow, no obstacle can push you back. Is that too much to change your life from nothing to something?‚Äù Sachdev goes on‚Ä¶\n\nI don‚Äôt like to talk about my childhood\n\nI was not god‚Äôs destined child. Being one of the three sons of a section officer in the Indian Railways, I had seen all hardships in life. I was an average child‚Äîneither any interest in studies nor in sports and games. Physics and chemistry were the subjects I hated, history scared me and I always avoided English. In fact, in government schools, like the one I had attended, there were no good teachers to motivate to do something good. And as I belonged to a middle class family, rather a lower middle class family, everybody was just striving to survive. There was no expectation from me and no attention was showered. I felt all alone in a family of five. In such circumstances, boys usually get into wrong things. But on the contrary, I was a very disciplined boy and the tough and turbulent circumstances made me serious quite early in life, to the extent that I started giving tuitions to those who were one class junior to me. In an effort to meet all ends, my father did small businesses but most of the time he was cheated by his partners and, hence, we grew up seeing several court cases and legal tangles, which affected the whole family mentally as well as financially.\n\nI always try to forget my childhood, although it provided a strong base to my life and prepared the ground where I‚Äôm standing today. But I dread going back and living those days again.\n\nHindu College was my best learning platform\n\nI was a naughty child and very stubborn‚Äîthat I still am‚Äîwhich I feel is a very positive quality and helped me to be what I‚Äôm today. Despite not being a good student, I managed to score well in my class 12 exam and got myself enrolled in statistics honours in Hindu College, Delhi University. That was the best learning platform in my life. I did everything I wanted to do in that short span of three years‚Äîtasted the bitter truth of politics, played the role of a kingmaker, learnt English as a challenge, and got into an affair for the first time in my life. There were good professors, yet I did not take much interest in studies. I was more of a ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs man‚Äô and became a good leader in college.\n\nI was always shy by nature and the sophisticated environment in Hindu College made me even more introvert. Boys and girls around me came from affluent families; they were sophisticated and always spoke in English. And I, coming from a government school, could not speak in English. I took it up as a challenge and started reading English novels, which really improved my English. I started opening up and made friends. I stood for the magazine manager‚Äôs post but lost. But I helped my friend win the post of the prime minister of the college. During my campaign for the post of the magazine manager, I went to different classes to give speeches. On one such occasion, when I was addressing a junior class, I was ridiculed and booed. But that day is still memorable because in that class I found my first girlfriend, Geeta. I may be sounding like a casanova here, so let me clarify‚Äîthat she was the last one, too, as I got married to her after three years of my graduation.\n\nMy first job was at Nai Sarak\n\nAfter graduation, I joined my elder brother to assist him in his pen distribution business. By that time, he was doing well in his business. He bought his own shop at Nai Sarak and also a car. For two years, I worked with my brothers (my younger brother had also joined my elder brother). However, my elder brother was fed up with my suggestions on how to expand the business. I always wanted my brother to move up from the mere distribution business and create a pen brand bigger than Luxor. But he found my ideas too much to handle. We started having arguments, which sometimes turned ugly. So I had to part ways with him. I always dream big. Small thinking and a blocked mind irritates me.\n\nI moved on. But the uncertain future stared hard at me. I dabbled in various commercial pursuits, including a law firm and a cable TV equipment manufacturing company. I had joined the cable company as a sales executive and learned a lot about cables and sales. But this job was equally shortlived. I had always thought of owning a business. In fact, I was ridiculed by my friends and relatives for airing such an ambition. Nothing could discourage me. Now is the time, I thought, to give a shape to my dream. I started a business of manufacturing cable equipment, with no technical background or management skills. People around me warned that it would not work, but I sported a ‚Äòcan do‚Äô attitude and was audacious enough to take the risk.\n\nMy cable TV business\n\nThat was the time when the cable TV boom had just begun to unveil in the country. Anticipating a good market for cable TV accessories like dish antennae, modulators, satellite receivers and amplifiers, I started Su-Kam in 1992 (the name I had decided in college days for my pen brand) to assemble and later manufacture these products on a very small scale. I had the experience of selling these products but no idea at all about the execution of a full-fledged business. I just jumped into the business and then realised how challenging and difficult it was. Till then I was cool in life but all of a sudden life made me serious.\n\nBy that time I was a married man and held responsibilities. There were times when I had no money, not even a penny to buy petrol for my scooter. As egoist as I am, I did not ask money from my wife, so I had to drag my scooter to a friend‚Äôs place to borrow some money for petrol. But I took every bit of life as a challenge.\n\nI got the advantage of being an early bird in the cable TV domain and as luck would have it, the brand became popular with cable operators in Delhi. Soon, my products were selling in other parts of north India. As I got a good hold on this business, I also managed to get the exclusive right to distribute products of Echo Star, USA, in India. By 1995, Su-Kam had expanded its operations and was doing respectable business. In those days, I made my first million in cable business. My friends said it was my first success. But I don‚Äôt call it a success. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a successful man. I only kept improving in life. I‚Äôm still struggling to be successful. Success is a very dangerous word. To me success is nothing but a continuous journey which never ends. It is like chasing some targets and setting new ones. After achieving one target, the chase for a new target begins.\n\nFailures made me stronger\n\nThere were big failures in my life and whenever I failed, mujhe maaza aa jaata hai. I take failures as challenges and challenges give me the boost. Every time I face failure, I emerge stronger. There was a time when I could not pay salary to my staff for at least three months. There were many such hardships in my life which I see as part of the learning process.\n\nNot having any technical knowledge and not being in a position to afford full time staff, I used to request my ex-colleagues to work for me after their office\n\nhours. But so late in the evening who had the energy to work? Whatever they made it started giving negative results and I got the flak from the customers. They abused me and lost faith in my product. It was then that I started learning myself. I blew off the dust from my old physics books and started reading them once again‚Äîthis time with interest. I started reading about electronics and I found my interest in the subject. For hours I used to get engrossed in these books. Days turned into nights but I did not have any realisation when I was into some experiments‚ÄîI used to open up mobile phones and other gadgets, remove all parts and experiment with them.\n\nDuring those days (in 1993) I bought a 20GHz spectrum analyser at a cost of Rs 25 lakh. I don‚Äôt think anybody in my place (and financial position) would have taken such a step. But I did. I did not tell my wife about it for 10 years, otherwise even she would have scoffed me for wasting money on a spectrum analyser at a time when she was building pressure on me to buy a house. Even after 10 years when I told her about it she fought with me. But I was passionate about learning and doing things in the right way. For me that was the priority, not a house.\n\nInverter business started off with failure\n\nThe cable TV accessories business had reached its peak and by 1997 the growth had hit the plateau. But I wanted to move ahead to bigger things. Success in the cable TV accessories business gave me the confidence to think bigger and I started believing in myself. I was restless to find new avenues for growth. Suddenly, I got the opportunity and in 1997 I started my inverter business.\n\nAt my home the inverter stopped functioning. Exhausted, I took it on myself and opened it up and repaired it according to my knowledge. There was no inverter brand at that time. I felt there was tremendous business opportunity which was waiting to be exploited. I strongly believed that inverters, if manufactured and marketed well, would become popular in households and small shops. I imported inverters from other countries and studied them. I didn‚Äôt have any R&D team.\n\nAn area which has always been high on my priority was investment in R&D. R&D not only enables us to keep ahead of competition but also helps us to bring the cost of production down. I got hold of a technical person and asked him to help me make an inverter. He was very reluctant as he never made an inverter before. But I motivated him for months, and he made one successfully. I went on collecting such people and made them successful. That‚Äôs how my R&D team was developed.\n\nVideocon imported a good inverter at that time. We copied that product. But Videocon closed down because of the failure of that product. It wasn‚Äôt a smooth ride for us, too. Quality issues kept cropping up. But I modified the product and for one year I did business with that one product. I installed the inverter at my friend‚Äôs places who tore me apart when the inverters failed. I personally visited my customers‚Äô houses and checked the inverters. Deep into the night, I used to sit with my employees and experimented and re-experimented with this product and finally made it successful.\n\nEntrepreneurship was always at the back of my mind. I always intended to do something big, always looking out for innovative products. I can boast of my ability of strategic vision and understanding of the market potential. I had no knowledge about the power backup industry but had the zeal to venture into new avenues. Su-Kam started climbing the chart steadily but strongly. Low cost and hands-on approach have been the key drivers of Su-Kam‚Äôs competitiveness.\n\nConstant innovation reflects Su-Kam‚Äôs commitment towards customers. We have been changing our approach and technology with the rapidly changing requirements of the customers. Taking this strategy further, I started production in batteries. Since inverter and batteries are complimentary products, it will enable us to offer a more economical bargain to the customer. Constant improvement in power protection systems will always be my first priority. Now, we are into solar and LED. While solar business has picked up quite well, we have just ventured into LED. We have started three pilot projects in solar-powered LED lighting‚Äîin Nepal, Nigeria and Malaysia.\n\nMy wife is my strength\n\nMy wife Geeta was a topper in the university, and I was so ordinary in studies. As the saying goes, opposites attract, we came closer and became life partners in 1987. Geeta had to elope with me as her parents did not accept our marriage‚Äîand they were right‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have a job at that time, while her‚Äôs was an established business family. We first stayed in a small rented house at Anand Vihar, then shifted to Janakpuri. Geeta taught mathematics in British School for 15 years. Today she helps me in my business. She is the HR head of Su-Kam.\n\nMy wife has been a strong pillar in my life, the biggest support through all ups and downs. She understood me and gave me space during my struggling days. Her positive attitude and liveliness stand her apart.\n\nI‚Äôm gifted with two sons‚ÄîKanav and Shourrya‚Äîboth studied in the British School. Kanav is now doing graduation from London and Shourrya is in class 10. I put no pressure on my sons to do extraordinarily well in studies and have left to them to decide their future. They can join my business or do whatever they wish to. But if they want to join Su-Kam they have to come through merit. They have to join as an executive and undergo training. They have to make themselves acceptable to the organisation. Moreover, it will be the management‚Äôs decision. My sons know that. I‚Äôve not given them the mindset to think that they can just come and take my chair.\n\nThere is a lot of pressure on my sons. When parents are successful, children feel the pressure thinking if they can match the level of their parents. Parents have to make themselves the role models for their children. Today, children question their parents. They can ask you, ‚Äúwhat have you done in life? Are you successful in life?‚Äù So showing them the right direction in life is by walking on the right path ourselves.\n\nMaterialistic things don‚Äôt stir me\n\nI bought my first car in 1989 but my own house came late‚Äîin 1998. These materialistic things did not stir me. They were just ‚Äòto be done‚Äô things in my priority list. Once I visited Gurgoan and I liked the place because of its calm environment. I always wanted to stay away from the crowd. I fear the crowd. That‚Äôs the reason I never go to Karol Bagh or Chandni Chowk. For work, I can even go into the bylanes of Varanasi but not otherwise. I had already set up my office and factory in Delhi and also bought a land for a factory in Gurgaon. When my wife wanted a house I gave her a condition‚Äîhouse in Gurgaon or nowhere. Initially, she was very reluctant to move out of Janakpuri. But I did not give her any choice. At times, I am unnecessarily stubborn, without any logic.\n\nMy shifting to Gurgaon is an interesting story. On one New Year‚Äôs eve, my family and I went to visit our new house in Gurgaon and decided to spend the night there. In the morning, I told my wife that I‚Äôll not go back to our house in Delhi and that she should go and get our luggage and furniture. That‚Äôs how I shifted to Gurgaon‚Äîovernight!\n\nI‚Äôm a creator as well as a destroyer\n\nI‚Äôm a simple person and like to believe in people. As a result, many a times, people have fooled me. Many people commit big promises to me and I believe them. At the end of the day, I realise that they were fooling me. I lose my time, money and also faith. But still I like to believe in people and that‚Äôs my strength. By believing in people I can ingrain confidence in them. Out of 100, five must have cheated me, but 95 others have become successful because I trusted them, gave them the opportunity to do something, and in the process ingrained confidence in them. That‚Äôs why I call it my strength.\n\nI may boast of my ability to motivate people. I believe in giving the requisite independence to people to take decisions in their respective spheres and grow professionally. I invest a lot in people‚Äîsome become good invests, some bad. Today I‚Äôm here because of such people.\n\nI‚Äôve no attachment in life‚Äîno attachment with car, house, wealth or even relationships. My penthouse is being built inside the Gurgaon Golf Course; it is one of the most expensive properties in Gurgaon. But who cares? People around me fear that one day I may even leave Su-Kam and get into some other business. They are so correct‚ÄîI‚Äôm planning to detach myself from Su-Kam, too. I‚Äôve already given my reins to my CEO Venkat Rajaraman. Now I‚Äôm more of a mentor to Su-Kam, giving direction to it.\n\nI‚Äôll not say goodye to electronics, but am definitely looking for new avenues. I may soon venture into food business under the brand name Su-Bake. We don‚Äôt get international quality bread or cakes in India. I want to make these here in India. Do you know that in India breads are made of oxidants which are band? It‚Äôs an interesting field and I‚Äôll learn a lot.\n\nAfter a certain age, you start realising that you have done quite a number of wrongs in life. Given a chance I would like to overcome my anger. A lot of times it badly affected my life. I‚Äôm a creator and a destroyer as well. I‚Äôve destroyed so many things in life. For example, I‚Äôve created many people from scratch but I‚Äôm the one who destroyed them. At one time I was their strength. But the moment I took my hands off their shoulder, they were destroyed. Today, I regret that. It‚Äôs not a good thing to destroy anybody. I‚Äôll never do that again.\n\nFive years down the line\n\nI cannot say that whatever I‚Äôve wished I‚Äôve achieved in life. But I‚Äôve no complaints. In the inverter segment, we are very successful in India. We are the biggest Indian exporter of inverters. We have not let China enter the Indian inverter market. But 95 per cent of the UPS market is captured by China and in the next five years I want to take away this market from China. With Venkat and our team, we have taken a pledge‚Äîwithin five years we will take away 50-60 per cent of the UPS market from China. We are working hard on that front.\n\nI don‚Äôt plan my career or my life, I take things as they come. I do planning, but more than that I believe in execution. Even before planning I think about the execution part.\n\nI read a book called Good to Great, which says if you have good people with you, they can take you anywhere you want; average people can take you to a certain level; and below average can take you nowhere. Su-Kam has a very good team now which is ready to take a new dimension. People ask me what I do to maintain or retain my team. It never happened that people ever left me. I‚Äôve left them whenever I didn‚Äôt want to work with them. What does people want from you‚Äîappreciation, freedom, space‚Äîand I give them all. But then if somebody cheats on me, I get wild. I know that‚Äôs a negative side of me and I‚Äôm trying to overcome it.\n\nWhere do I see myself five years down the line? Well. I‚Äôve always been a very confused man, I‚Äôm still very confused and will die a confused man. I‚Äôm still trying to know myself. Till date, I don‚Äôt know what I want from life. I‚Äôm lost, looking for something but I don‚Äôt know what.\n\nYou cannot predict life. I keep changing the course of my life. Tomorrow I may think of taking sanyas or leaving Su-Kam altogether. That‚Äôs nothing unusual about me, everybody knows about that. I want change in life. I want to keep learning in life and trying new things.\n\nI can do anything in life, you just challenge me. I‚Äôve no fear in life as I‚Äôve gone through all hardships and failures.\n\nI also want to play a social role but I don‚Äôt know how? I‚Äôm not a temple-going person and I don‚Äôt believe in giving charity to a temple. If I can change the mindset of a few people, I feel it will be a social work.\n\nGod doesn‚Äôt give everything to every one. In fact, he shouldn‚Äôt give. If one gets too much he will not value life. He will not work hard to achieve it. My suggestion to the youth would be‚Äîbe passionate and create an identity for yourself first. Money will automatically come. It took me years to create an image and today that image is working.\n\nThese are a few of my favourite things‚Ä¶\n\nFavourite music: Ghazals by Jagjit Singh (I become very sentimental when I hear them)\n\nFavourite food: Paneer (I can have it for breakfast, lunch, dinner)\n\nFavourite film: Lakshya of Hrithik Roshan (whenever, its shown on TV, I watch it)\n\nFavourite book: Good to Great and Execution\n\nFavourite dress: Jeans and t-shirts\n\nFavourite colour: Blue\n\nFavourite historical figure: Sardar Patel and Lal Bahadur Shastri\n\nFavourite pastime: Playing squash and swimming, reading books, talking on the phone\n\nYour strength: I‚Äôm very disciplined, punctual and fitness freak"

During the pendency of the suit, a Liquidator had been\nappointed who has adopted the pleadings, averments and arguments\nadvanced by the resolution professional.\n\nARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF\n\n3.    Mr. Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff stated\nthat the present suit was liable to be decreed summarily as the\ndefendant no. 1 had no real prospect of defending its claim and the\ndefendant no. 1‚Äüs defence was an abuse of the process of law.\n\n4.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the\ndefendant No.1 had made numerous admissions that the plaintiff was\nthe rightful owner, proprietor and user of the Su-Kam Marks in respect\nof goods covered under Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999and\nsuch admissions supersede any and all issues, including those disputed\nby the defendants. He pointed out the following instances wherein the\ndefendant No.1 had represented the plaintiff to be the owner of the Su-\nKam Marks:-\n\n5.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff stated that the defendant\nno.1, by his representations/acts/admissions, had intentionally caused\nothers, including the plaintiff, to believe that the plaintiff was the\nrightful owner of the ‚ÄûSu-Kam‚Äü marks in Class 9 of theTrade Marks\nAct, 1999and was now estopped from denying the said truth or\npleading to the contrary.In support of his submission, he relied on the\nSupreme Court judgment inJai Narain Parasrampuria (Dead) and\nOthers Vs. Pushpa Devi Saraf and Others, (2006) 7 SCC 756\nwherein it has been held as under:-\n\nbut it is another thing to say that a person is estopped from\n     raising a question of title. The provisions of theEvidence\n     Actare clear likeSection 116, whereby in a certain\n     situation a person may be estopped from pleading a title in\n     himself.\n\nxxxx          xxxx          xxxx        xxxx\n\n36. In the instant case, it was Sarafs who represented the\n     Company. They had made the representation that the\n     Company was the owner of the property. Such a\n     representation had been made to the appellant herein not\n     only in terms of the decree obtained in the said OS No. 267\n     of 1980, but by reason of execution of the other documents\n     including creation of mortgage of the property and\n     discharge thereof in favour of State Bank of India. If by\n     reason of such representation, a third party alters hisCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 4 of 77position, indisputably, the principle of estoppel would apply.\n     We may, however, hasten to add that where there exists a\n     statutory embargo, vesting of title in a person shall be\n     subject thereto. We have, however, in this case, no doubt\n     whatsoever that there did not exist any statutory embargo in\n     this behalf.‚Äñ\n\n6.     Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff emphasized that\ndefendant no.1 had not come to this Court with clean hands, had made\ngross misrepresentations and had taken contradictory stands on\nvarious occasions. He pointed out the following instances which\naccording to him disentitled the defendant no.1 from seeking a trial in\nthe suit:-\n\n7.    Per contra, Mr. Rajeev Virmani, learned senior counsel for\ndefendant no. 1 contended that oral evidence was required to be led in\nthe present suit as the plaint alleged that the Deed of Assignment dated\n16th March, 2006 as well as the Trade Mark Licence Agreement dated\n7th July, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'TMLA') were questionable\nand sought declarations that the Deed of Assignment was fabricated\nand the TMLA had stood terminated respectively.\n\n8.    He also pointed out that though the plaint averred that the\nBusiness Transfer Agreement dated 16th September, 1999 (for short\n\"BT Agreement\") and the Minutes of the Meeting dated 20th March,\n2006 (for short \"Minutes\") were fabricated, yet no relief had been\nclaimed qua the said BT Agreement and Minutes.\n\n9.     He emphasised that while the plaintiff had filed an expert\nforensic report in support of some of its allegations, the defendant no.1\nhad also filed contrary forensic reports to deny any allegation of\nfabrication. He contended that the defendant no.1 had denied all\nallegations   of     documents   being    fabricated   or   questionable.\nConsequently, according to Mr. Virmani, the issue that would arise in\nthe matter is whether the impugned documents were fabricated or\nquestionable or authentic. He submitted that where contentious issues\nof fraud and fabrication arise, a suit cannot be decided summarily and\nwithout oral evidence.In support of his submission, he relied upon a\njudgment of the Supreme Court inState Bank of Saurashtra vs.\nAshit Shipping Services (P) Ltd. & Anr., (2002) 4 SCC 736, wherein\nit has been held as under:-\n\n10.    He stated that the plaintiff had no reasonable prospect of\nsucceeding in its claim as the defendant no. 1 had started using theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 7 of 77SU-KAM Mark as its proprietor in 1986. He stated that the defendant\nno.1 had coined and adopted the trademark Su-Kam in the year 1986\nand was the proprietor of the trade mark Su-Kam in all classes, except\nfor Class 9, under theTrade Marks Act, 1999.\n\n11.   He pointed out that the defendant no. 1, in partnership with his\nfather, had started the firm Su-Kam Communication Systems on 23rd\nApril, 1981 and licenced the trade mark SU-KAM to the partnership\nfirm vide the aforesaid TMLA. He contended that the TMLA was a\nvalid agreement.\n\n12.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no.1 stated that the\nplaintiff Company was incorporated on 14th October, 1998. He stated\nthat the BT Agreement was entered between the partnership firm (i.e.\nM/s. Su-Kam Communication Systems) and SU-KAM Power Systems\nLtd.(the plaintiff herein), whereby not only did the plaintiff become\nthe successor in interest of the said partnership firm but also the\ntrademark licence was transferred to the plaintiff. He stated that the\nBT Agreement which was filed with the Registrar of Companies along\nwith return of allotment in 2002, clearly recorded defendant no.1 to be\nthe owner of the Su-Kam marks, ‚Äï4. The trade mark / Brand Name\n‚ÄïSU-KAM‚Äñ shall remain the property of Mr. Kunwer Deep Sachdeva,\nProp M/s SU-KAM CABLE TV SYSTEMS, New Delhi. The trade mark/\nAmount of Royalty for using the brand name SU-KAM shall be\nmutually decided between the company and Kunwer Deep Sachdeva\nfrom Year to Year basis.‚Äñ He emphasised that under the BT\nAgreement, the plaintiff had acknowledged that the partnership firm\nwas engaged in the Inverter business. Thus, according to him, theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                       Page 8 of 77plaintiff being the licencee, could not have proprietary rights in the\nSU-KAM trade mark.\n\n13.   He reiterated that though defendant no. 1 had applied for SU-\nKAM in class 9 vide the Trade Mark Application No. 821727 on 5th\nOctober, 2008 (i.e. prior to incorporation of plaintiff-company), yet\nthe trade mark records showed that the said mark had been registered\nin the name of the plaintiff, ignoring the claim of defendant no. 1. He\nstated that upon discovery of said mistake, the said Deed of\nAssignment had been executed by the plaintiff in favour of the\ndefendant no. 1. He contended that the plaintiff had not provided any\nparticulars as to how the said Deed of Assignment was fabricated.\n\n14.   He further submitted that an assignment takes effect from the\ndate of assignment and an assignee acquires title in a trademark\nimmediately upon execution of the assignment deed. He pointed out\nthat any follow up actions required to be taken under theTrade Marks\nAct, 1999, following the execution of an assignment deed would not\nchange the title already acquired.In support of his submission, he\nrelied onSun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited vs. Cipla Limited,\n2009 (108) DRJ 207, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n15.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no.1 submitted that\nprior to the amendment of theTrade Marks Act, 1999in 2010, in\nterms of Section 45(2) of the erstwhileTrade Marks Act, 1999, an\nassignment deed could not have been read in evidence in any Court or\ntribunal without express directions of the Court or Tribunal. He stated,\nhowever, that this provision stood deleted byThe Trade Marks\nAmendment Act, 2010. He submitted that the effect of such deletion is\nthat a non-recordal of assignment by the assignee makes the\nassignment ineffective only against third parties and not against the\nassignor itself, who is aware of the existence/execution of the\ndocument.\n\n16.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no.1 contended that\nthere had been no abandonment of the trademark Su-Kam by the\ndefendant no.1. He contended that in terms of Clause 5 of the TMLA,\nall use of the trade mark would enure to the benefit of the Licensor,\ni.e. defendant no.1.\n\n17.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 stated that the\nrepresentations to Reliance India Power Fund were dated 27th\nFebruary 2006, i.e. prior to execution of Deed of Assignment. In any\nevent, he stated that at that stage defendant no. 1 and his family ownedCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 10 of 77the entire shareholding of the plaintiff company and the defendant\nno. 1 treated the company as its alter-ego and did not consider the\ncompany to be separate from defendant no.1.\n\n18.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 stated that the\ndefendant no. 1 did not sign the plaint of the infringement suit filed in\n2015 by the plaintiff. He pointed out that the plaintiff did not authorise\nthe person signing the plaint and was unaware of the said suit. He\nstated that, in any event, in terms of the TMLA, the plaintiff was\nobligated to maintain the licensed trademark, i.e. SU-KAM, including\ntaking all actions to protect the said trademark. He emphasised that\nthe plaintiff had instituted the suit in 2015 in discharge of its\nobligations under the TMLA.\n\n19.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 stated that, the\nErnst and Young Report was based on assertions made by the plaintiff\nand as stated in the report no independent trade mark search had been\nconducted. He pointed out that the plaintiff had also filed another\nvaluation report of the trademark Su-Kam by VGrow Advisors Pvt.\nLtd. which specified that the trademark being valued belonged to the\ndefendant no. 1.\n\n20.   Learned senior counsel for the defendant no. 1 contended that\nthe question of estoppel in the present suit did not arise as the plaintiff\nhad acknowledged the defendant no.1 to be the proprietor of the\ntrademark Su-Kam in the BT Agreement. He contended that the\nplaintiff was all along aware of the true facts regarding the defendant\nno.1‚Äüs ownership of the Su-Kam marks and there could be no estoppel\nwhere truth is known to both parties. In support of his contention, heCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                           Page 11 of 77relied on Mohori Bibee and Another vs. Dharmodas Ghose, 7 CWN\n441, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n21.   Mr.Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff handed\nover an affidavit dated 02nd May, 2019, whereby the plaintiff gave up\nparts of prayer (a) and (b), which were premised on allegations of\nfraud and fabrication and prayer (g)       pertaining to damages. The\nrelevant portion of the affidavit dated 02nd May, 2019, is reproduced\nhereinbelow-\n\n‚Äï15. I hereby state that in view of the foregoing, the\n         Plaintiff is hereby giving up its claims based on fraud\n         and fabrication and consequent relief(s) based thereon,\n         for the purposes of the Application for Summary\n         Judgment underOrder XIIIA of CPC, and is agreeableCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 12 of 77to lesser prayers being granted on the basis of the\n         categorical admissions and holding out by the\n         Defendant No.1, inter alia, as to ownership of the SU-\n         KAM Marks vesting in the Plaintiff. Therefore, the\n         Plaintiff hereby states that it hereby gives up the\n         following prayers, which are premised on the\n         allegations of fraud and fabrication, as stated\n         hereinafter:\n\n16. I am advised that even otherwise the reliance by the\n        Defendant No.1 on the Deed of Assignment dated March\n        16, 2006 in his defence ought to be rejected in view of the\n        fact that the said Deed is invalid and that the Defendant\n        No.1 cannot rely upon the same on the grounds that the\n        Deed of Assignment has been executed by him in breach\n        of his fiduciary duty under law; the holding out by himCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 13 of 77that the Plaintiff is the sole owner and registered\n        proprietor of the SU-KAM Marks and the consequent\n        estoppel under law; and his failure to act upon the Deed\n        of Assignment for a period of 12 years from the execution\n        thereof. I am advised that the said defence can be\n        rejected by this Hon'ble Court on the said basis without it\n        having to pass an order of declaration. Further, I say that\n        insofar as the Trade Mark License Agreement dated July\n        7, 1995 is concerned, the Plaintiff is seeking a limited\n        relief that the same is not and never was applicable to it.\n        I am advised that such an Order is not based on\n        allegations of fraud and fabrication and can be granted\n        by this Hon'ble Court without trial. I also state that the\n        Plaintiff is entitled to other reliefs as prayed for in\n        prayers (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) and (i).‚Äñ\n\n22.   The amended prayer clause handed over by learned senior\ncounsel for plaintiff on 03rd May, 2019 is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n23.   Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff contended that if the\nplaintiff is able to show that the defendant has no real prospect of\nsuccessfully defending the claim, then unless the defendant shows that\nthere is a compelling reason to lead oral evidence, summary judgment\nmust be granted in favour of the plaintiff. He submitted that the onus\non the defendant for summary judgment is lower than the judgment onCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                       Page 15 of 77admission. He further submitted that judgment on admission is\ndiscretionary, whereas summary judgment must be granted where the\nCourt finds that either plaintiff or defendant has no real prospect of\nsucceeding or there is no compelling reason to lead oral evidence. He\nstated that discretion in grant of summary judgment lies in moulding\nthe relief only.\n\n24.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that\nthe test for summary judgment is not whether the defence is a sham or\nmoonshine-which is the test for leave to defend in a summary suit. He\nsubmitted that the standard in a summary judgment should be lower\nthan that of a summary suit because there the Court has to decide\nwhether to allow a defence at all; whereas, in a summary judgment the\ndefence is on record as both the parties are duty bound to state on oath\nthat they have disclosed all documentary evidence in their possession.\n\n25.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff stated that Rule 24 of the\nCivil Procedure Rules in England is pari materia to Order XIII-A.\nLearned senior counsel for plaintiff relied upon the test for summary\njudgment laid down by Courts in England and Wales inEasyair\nLimited v. Opal Telecom Limited[2009] EWHC 339 (Ch.)which was\nreiterated in Ruanne Dellal v. Guy Dellal, [2015] EWHC 907 (Fam)\nand is reproduced hereinbelow-\n\n‚Äïi) The court must consider whether the claimant has a\n      \"realistic\" as opposed to a \"fanciful\" prospect of\n      success: Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91;\n\nii) A \"realistic\" claim is one that carries some degree of\n      conviction. This means a claim that is more than merely\n      arguable: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel [2003]\n      EWCA Civ 472 at [8];\n\niii) In reaching its conclusion the court must not conduct a\n     \"mini-trial\": Swain v Hillman;\n\niv) This does not mean that the court must take at face value\n     and without analysis everything that a claimant says in his\n     statements before the court. In some cases it may be clear\n     that there is no real substance in factual assertions made,\n     particularly    if   contradicted    by    contemporaneous\n     documents: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel at [10];\n\nv) However, in reaching its conclusion the court must take\n     into account not only the evidence actually placed before it\n     on the application for summary judgment, but also the\n     evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at\n     trial: Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond (No\n\n5) [2001] EWCA Civ 550;\n\nvi) Although a case may turn out at trial not to be really\n     complicated, it does not follow that it should be decided\n     without the fuller investigation into the facts at trial than is\n     possible or permissible on summary judgment. Thus the court\n     should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial,\n     even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of\n     the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing\n     that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add\n     to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so\n     affect the outcome of the case: Doncaster Pharmaceuticals\n     Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd [2007] FSR\n     63;\n\nvii) On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application\n     under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or\n     construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it\n     all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the\n     question and that the parties have had an adequate\n     opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the\n     nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the\n     respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real\n     prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending\n     the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 17 of 77applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined,\n      the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although\n      material in the form of documents or oral evidence that\n      would put the documents in another light is not currently\n      before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be\n      expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give\n      summary judgment because there would be a real, as\n      opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not\n      enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go\n      to trial because something may turn up which would have a\n      bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemicals &\n      Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 725.\"\n\n26.     Learned senior counsel for plaintiff submitted that summary\njudgment could be refused if there was a compelling reason to conduct\na trial. The learned senior counsel referred to Blackstone's Civil\nPractice: The Commentary and stated that compelling reasons for\ngoing to trial include -\n\n‚Äï(a) The respondent is unable to contact a material\n        witness who may provide material for a defence.\n\n(b) The case is highly complicated such that judgment\n        should only be given after mature consideration at trial.\n\n(c) The facts are wholly within the applicant's hands. In\n        such a case it may be unjust to enter judgment without\n        giving the respondent an opportunity of establishing a\n        defence in the light of disclosure or after serving a request\n        for further information. However, summary judgment will\n        not necessarily be refused in cases where the evidence for\n        any possible defence could only lie with the applicant if\n        there is nothing devious or artificial in the claim.\n\n(d) The applicant has acted harshly or unconscionably,\n        or the facts disclose a suspicion of dishonesty or\n        deviousness on the part of the applicant such thatCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 18 of 77judgment should only be obtained in the light of publicity\n        at trial.‚Äñ\n\n27.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff stated that the only reason\nfor going to trial, in the present case, as set out by the defendant no.1\nwas that the plaintiff had made allegations of fraud and fabrication and\ncertain prayers were sought based on these allegations. He pointed out\nthat this reason no longer survived inasmuch as the plaintiff had given\nup those prayers by filing an affidavit dated 02nd May, 2019.\n\n28.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff contended that defendant\nno.1 had made no averment in his pleadings with respect to actual use\nof the marks for inverters and in absence of such pleading, he could\nnot lead evidence for the same. He emphasised that reliance on trade\nmark registrations which were not in respect of inverters were in any\ncase liable for cancellation on account of non-use.In support of his\nsubmission, he relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court inAmerican Home Products Corporation Vs. Mac Laboratories Pvt.\nLtd. & Anr., (1986) 1 SCC 465, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n29.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff emphasised that the\nplaintiff‚Äüs use of the SU-KAM mark for the inverter business was not\npursuant to any licence from the defendant no.1, but in its own right as\na proprietor of the mark. He pointed out that at the time of execution\nof the alleged TMLA, the licence was not for use of the SU-KAM\ntrademark for the inverter business but in respect of Cable TVs and\nrelated goods and services.\n\n30.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff contended, in any event,\nthat when the BT Agreement was executed, the mark Su-Kam was\nunregistered and only ownership of the goodwill in the existing\nbusiness of defendant no.1 or goods which used the Su-Kam mark,\nunder licence from defendant no.1, could have been transferred under\nthe BT Agreement. He emphasised that the only business which the\nerstwhile partnership was engaged in, at that time, was the business of\nCable TV and that the defendant no.1 did not own any goodwill in the\ntrade mark Su-Kam in relation to the inverter business. He therefore\ncontended that the statement in the BT Agreement could, at the most,\nrefer to ownership of the trade mark Su-Kam in relation to the Cable\nTV business.\n\n31.    Learned senior counsel for plaintiff stated that the terms of BT\nAgreement stipulated that the Su-Kam would remain the property of\ndefendant no.1 and royalty in respect of the same would be decided\nbetween the plaintiff and defendant no.1. He stated that admittedly no\nroyalty for the use of the brand Su-Kam had ever been paid by the\nplaintiff.\n\n32.      Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff further stated that the\nDeed of Assignment dated 16th March, 2006, was invalid as it had\nbeen executed by the defendant no.1 on behalf of both, the assignor\nand the assignee and such act of the defendant no.1 was contrary to the\nduties placed on the Director of a company underSection 166of the\nCompanies Act, 2013. He reiterated that the Deed of Assignment had\nnever been acted upon by the defendant no.1 and a request for recordal\nof assignment was filed belatedly by the defendant no.1 on 18 th July,\n2018, only i.e. after a gap of twelve years, which showed his mala\nfides.\n\n33.      Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the\nexecution of Deed of Assignment was not authorised by the Board of\nDirectors on account of lack of proper quorum for the Board Meeting.\nHe stated that three members were present for the Board meeting on\n20th March, 2006, i.e. defendant no.1, Mrs. Geeta Sachdeva (wife of\ndefendant no.1) and Mr. Nagender Bajaj.          He contended that as\ndefendant no.1 and Mrs. Geeta Sachdeva were interested Directors,\nthey could not ‚Äïtake part in the discussions of or vote on‚Äñ in\naccordance with the mandate ofSection 300of the Companies Act,\n1956.      He submitted that due to defendant no.1 and his wife‚Äüs\nparticipation in the Board Meeting on 20th March, 2006 any resolution\npassed in the said meeting cannot be relied or acted upon.\n\nSUR-REJOINDER AND REPLY\n\n34.      At the fag end of the rejoinder arguments, learned counsel for\ndefendant no.1 filed an application underOrder VI Rule 17 CPCforCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                           Page 24 of 77amendment of the written statement incorporating the plea that the\npresent suit was barred by limitation. Learned counsel for defendant\nno.1 submitted that the present application for amendment was\nnecessitated in view of the amendment of the prayer clause by the\nplaintiff. The said amendment application was allowed vide order\ndated 23rd August, 2019 without prejudice to the rights and\ncontentions of either of the parties.\n\n35.   In sur-rejoinder, learned senior counsel for defendant no.1\nsubmitted that the prayer regarding invalidity of the Deed of\nAssignment dated 16th March, 2006 was barred by limitation as the\nsame could not be raised thirteen years after its execution because\nEntry 58 of theSchedule to the Limitation Act, 1963stipulated that\nthe limitation for obtaining a declaration stating that the document is\ninvalid is limited to ‚Äïthree years from when the right to sue accrued‚Äñ.\n\n36.   According to learned senior counsel for defendant no.1, in the\npresent case the right to sue would accrue from the date the Deed of\nAssignment was entered i.e. 16th March, 2006. Hence, he submitted\nthat the relief claimed by the plaintiff with regard to the declaration of\ninvalidity of the Deed of Assignment was barred by limitation.\n\n37.   He lastly submitted that plaintiff‚Äüs arguments with regard to\nlack of quorum and interested directors were irrelevant and should not\nbe examined by this Court as it was not mandatory for the Board of\nDirectors to approve/sanction the Deed of Assignment.\n\n38.   In reply, Mr. Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff\nsubmitted that the right to sue accrued in favour of plaintiff only in\n2018 when defendant no.1 denied plaintiff‚Äüs title to the SU-KAMCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 25 of 77marks in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999and claimed ownership\nbefore the Interim Resolution Professional. This according to him\nresulted in the general public being deterred from submitting\nresolution plans for plaintiff and consequently, only one resolution\nplan had been received and that too from defendant no.1. Plaintiff\nalso placed reliance onSections 31and34of the Specific Relief Act,\n1963.\n\nCOURT'S REASONING\nUNDER RULE 3 OF ORDER XIII-ACPCTHERE WILL BE ‚ÄóNO\nREAL PROSPECT OF SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING THE\nCLAIM' WHEN THE COURT IS ABLE TO MAKE THE\nNECESSARY FINDING OF FACT, APPLY THE LAW TO THE\nFACTS, AND THE SAME IS A PROPORTIONATE, MORE\nEXPEDITIOUS AND LESS EXPENSIVE MEANS TO ACHIEVE\nA FAIR AND JUST RESULT.\n\n39.The Commercial Courts Act, 2015has been enacted with the\nintent to improve efficiency and reduce delay in disposal of\ncommercial cases. The relevant portion of the Statement of Objects\nand Reasons of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n40.   AmendedOrder XIIIA of CPC, as applicable to commercial\ndisputes, enables the Court to decide a claim or part thereof without\nrecording oral evidence.Order XIIIA of CPCseeks to avoid the long\ndrawn process of leading oral evidence in certain eventualities.\nConsequently, the said provision enables disposal of commercial\ndisputes in a time bound manner and promotes the object of theCommercial Courts Act, 2015.\n\n41.   Rule 3 of Order XIII-Aof CPCempowers the Court to grant a\nsummary judgment against a defendant where on an application filed\nin that regard, the Court considers that the defendant has no real\nprospect of successfully defending a claim, and there is no other\ncompelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before\nrecording of oral evidence. Order XIIIA (3)of CPC, as applicable to\ncommercial disputes, is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n42.   Consequently, the new Rule, applicable to commercial disputes,\ndemonstrates that trial is no longer the default procedure/norm.\n\n43.   Rule 24.2 of Civil Procedure Rules in England is identical to\nRule 3 ofOrder XIIIA of CPC. It refers to the words ‚Äóno realCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 27 of 77prospect' of being successful or succeeding. Rule 24.2 of Civil\nProcedure Rules in England is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n44.   While deciding the test for summary judgment under Rule 24.2,\nHouse of Lords in Three Rivers District Council and Others vs.\nGovernor and Company of the Bank of England [2003] 2 A.C. 1,\nreiterated the observation in Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 that\nthe word ‚Äóreal' distinguishes ‚Äófanciful' prospects of success and it\ndirects the Court to examine whether there is a ‚Äórealistic' as opposed\nto a ‚Äófanciful' prospect of success. The House of Lords in Three\nRivers District Council (supra) also held that the Court while\nconsidering the words ‚Äóno real prospect' should look to see what will\nhappen at the trial and that if the case is so weak that it has no\nreasonable prospect of success, it should be stopped before great\nexpenses are incurred. The relevant portion of the Three Rivers\nDistrict Council (supra) judgment is reproduced hereinebelow:-\n\n[92] The overriding objective of the CPR is to enable the\n    court to deal with cases justly: rule 1.1. To adopt the\n    language ofarticle 6(1)of the European Convention for the\n    Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n    with which this aim is consistent, the court must ensure that\n    there is a fair trial. It must seek to give effect to the\n    overriding objective when it exercises any power given to it\n    by the Rules or interprets any rule: rule 1.2. While the\n    difference between the two tests is elusive, in many cases the\n    practical effect will be the same. In more difficult and\n    complex cases such as this one, attention to the overriding\n    objective of dealing with the case justly is likely to be more\n    important than a search for the precise meaning of the rule.\n    As May LJ said in Purdy v Cambran (unreported) 17\n    December 1999: Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript\n    No 2290 of 1999:\n\n45.   The Supreme Court of Canada in Robert Hryniak v. Fred\nMauldin and Ors, 2014 SCC OnLine Can SC 53 has also held that\ntrial should not be the default procedure. In the said case, which was\nan action for civil fraud against the appellant and a corporate lawyer,\nwho acted for the appellant, the allegation was that the appellant,\nthrough that company, had transferred more than US $10 million to an\noffshore bank following which he claimed that the money had been\nstolen. That money had initially been transferred to the appellant‚Äüs\ncompany, by the respondents therein, in respect of an investment\nopportunity.\n\n46.   The Trial Court as well as the Court of Appeal considered Rule\n20 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure (RCP) and the appropriate\nstandard of review in granting a summary judgment. Rule 20 of RCP\nreads as: ‚Äï....(1) The court shall grant a summary judgment if, (a) theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 31 of 77court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with\nrespect to a claim or defence; or (b) the parties agree to have all or\npart of the claim determined by a summary judgment and the court is\nsatisfied that it is appropriate to grant summary judgment. (2.1) In\ndetermining under clause (2)(a) whether there is a genuine issue\nrequiring a trial, the court shall consider the evidence submitted by\nthe parties.....‚Äñ. It is pertinent to mention that the amendments to the\nRCP in December 2008 changed the test from ‚Äïa genuine issue for\ntrial‚Äñ to whether ‚Äïthere is a genuine issue requiring trial‚Äñ. The case\nwas thereafter referred to the Supreme Court of Canada by way of an\nappeal from the Court of Appeal.\n\n47.   The Supreme Court of Canada, despite allegation of fraud, did\nnot exercise the power to record oral evidence. Instead, the Court\ngranted summary judgment in favour of the respondents/plaintiff on\nthe basis of the material/pleadings already available with it. The Court\nheld that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial when the judge is\nable to reach a fair and just determination on the merits on a motion\nfor summary judgment. The Court further held that that is the case\nwhen the process allows the judge to make necessary findings of fact,\nallows the judge to apply the law to such facts and when such a\nprocess is proportionate, more expeditious and a less expensive means\nof achieving a just result. Consequently, when a summary judgment\nmotion allows the judge to find the necessary facts and resolve the\ndispute, it would not be necessary to proceed to trial. In this regard\nthe standard for fairness is whether or not the procedure involved in a\nsummary judgment would give the judge the confidence to findCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 32 of 77necessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles to resolve the\ndispute. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n(2.1) [Powers] In determining under clause (2)(a) whether\n      there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, the court shall\n      consider the evidence submitted by the parties and, if the\n      determination is being made by a judge, the judge may\n      exercise any of the following powers for the purpose, unless\n      it is in the interest of justice for such powers to be exercised\n      only at a trial:\n\n(2.2) [Oral Evidence (Mini-Trial)] A judge may, for the\n      purposes of exercising any of the powers set out in sub-rule\n      (2.1), order that oral evidence be presented by one or more\n      parties, with or without time limits on its presentation.\n\n[43] The Ontario amendments changed the test for summary\n      judgment from asking whether the case presents ‚Äïa genuine\n      issue for trial‚Äñ to asking whether there is a ‚Äïgenuine\n      issue requiring a trial‚Äñ. The new rule, with its enhanced\n      fact-finding powers, demonstrates that a trial is not the\n      default procedure. Further, it eliminated the presumption of\n      substantial indemnity costs against a party that brought an\n      unsuccessful motion for summary judgment, in order to\n      avoid deterring the use of the procedure.\n\nxxx                xxx                xxx\n      [49] There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when\n      the judge is able to reach a fair and just determination on\n      the merits on a motion for summary judgment. This will be\n      the case when the process (1) allows the judge to make the\n      necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the\n      law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more\n      expeditious and less expensive means to achieve a just\n      result.\n\n[50] These principles are interconnected and all speak to\n      whether summary judgment will provide a fair and just\n      adjudication. When a summary judgment motion allows the\n      judge to find the necessary facts and resolve the dispute,\n      proceeding to trial would generally not be proportionate,\n      timely or cost effective. Similarly, a process that does not\n      give a judge confidence in her conclusions can never be the\n      proportionate way to resolve a dispute. It bears reiterating\n      that the standard for fairness is not whether the procedure\n      is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether it gives the judgeCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                       Page 36 of 77confidence that she can find the necessary facts and apply\n      the relevant legal principles so as to resolve the dispute.‚Äñ\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n48.   In fact, the Federal Court Ottawa, Ontario in Louis Vuitton\nMalletier S.A. v. Singga Enterprises (Canada) Inc., 2011 FC 776 and\nHigh Court of Ireland in Abbey International Finance Ltd. v. Point\nIreland Helicopters Ltd. Anr, [2012] IEHC 374, have held that even\ndamages as well as unliquidated compensation can be awarded by way\nof summary judgment. The relevant portion of the said judgments are\nreproduced hereinbelow:-\n\nadmittedly low-standard of proof which has to be achieved in\n      order to avoid summary judgment. In the absence of an\n      ability to seek summary judgment in a non-liquidated claim\n      an unmeritorious defendant can procrastinate for months or\n      perhaps years. That would be an obvious injustice to a\n      plaintiff in such a case.\n\n19. I believe there to be an inherent jurisdiction in the\n      court to enable a plaintiff to seek summary judgment in such\n      circumstances. It is true that there is no specific provision in\n      the Rules of the superior Courts to enable such anCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 38 of 77application to be brought, save in respect of cases in the\n      Commercial List to which I will turn in due course. But the\n      absence of a specific rule should not deny a meritorious\n      plaintiff from speedy relief against an unmeritorious\n      defendant in an appropriate case.‚Äñ\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n49.   Consequently, this Court is of the view that when a summary\njudgment application allows the Court to find the necessary facts and\nresolve the dispute, proceeding to trial would generally not be\nproportionate, timely or cost effective. It bears reiteration that the\nstandard for fairness is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a\ntrial, but whether it gives the Court the confidence that it can find the\nnecessary facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to resolve\nthe dispute as held in Robert Hryniak (supra).\n\n50.   In fact, the legislative intent behind introducing summary\njudgment underOrder XIIIA of CPCis to provide a remedy\nindependent, separate and distinct from judgment on admissions and\nsummary judgment underOrder XXXVII of CPC.\n\n51.   This Court clarifies that in its earlier judgment inVenezia\nMobili (India) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Ramprastha Promoters & Developers\nPvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7761 while deciding two\napplications, both filed by the plaintiff in the said case (one under\nOrder XII Rule 6 and other under Order XIIIA) it had applied the\nlowest common denominator test under both the provisionsof the\nCode of Civil Procedureand held that the suit could be decreed by\nway of a summary judgment.\n\n52.   Consequently, this Court is of the opinion that there will be ‚Äóno\nreal prospect of successfully defending the claim' when the Court is\nable to reach a fair and just determination on the merits of the\napplication for summary judgment. This will be the case when the\nprocess allows the court to make the necessary finding of fact,\napply the law to the facts, and the same is a proportionate, more\nexpeditious and less expensive means to achieve a fair and just\nresult.\n\nAS THE PLAINTIFF HAS GIVEN UP ITS PRAYERS BASED ON\nFRAUD, THE SUBMISSION THAT SUCH RELIEFS CANNOT BE\nGRANTED WITHOUT A TRIAL IS OTIOSE.\n\n53.   In view of the plaintiff having given up its claims and prayers\nbased on fraud and fabrication by filing an affidavit dated 02 nd May,\n2019, the submission of defendant no.1 that such reliefs cannot be\ngranted without a trial does not survive.\n\nSINCE THE PLAINTIFF IS THE EXCLUSIVE REGISTERED\nPROPRIETOR OF THE MARKS SU-KAM IN CLASS 9, THE\nDEFENDANT NO. 1'S SUBMISSIONS WITH REGARD TO EARLIER\nTMLA OR BT AGREEMENT AND/OR SUBSEQUENT DEED OF\nASSIGNMENT ARE BASELESS AND INCONSEQUENTIAL.\n\n54.   In the present case, plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the\nmark SU-KAM with respect to inverters which falls within the scope\nof Class 9-in which class admittedly defendant no.1 has no\nregistration. Registration certificates for the marks SU-KAM in favour\nof the plaintiff in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999along with\nstatus pages from Trade Marks Registry‚Äüs E-Register are reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\nAs annexed\n\n\n\n\nSealed at my direction this          05th           day of February, 2011\n                                                      Sd/-\n\nCertificate Detail   Certificate No. 925845 Dated : 05/02/2011\nValid upto/          09/03/2026\nRenewed upto\nProprietor name     (1) SU-KAM POWER SYSTEMS LTD;\n\nBody Incorporate\nProprietor Address WZ-1401/2, NANGAL RAYA NEW DELHI-110046.\n\nFOR BATTERIES OF DIFFERENT TYPES AND SIZES,\n                    BATTERY WATER, SOLAR INVERTERS, CHARGE\n                    CONTROLLERS AND POWER CONDITIONING UNITS (PCU)\n                    AND OTHER SOLAR ENERGY RELATED PRODUCTS\"\n\n55.      From the aforesaid Certificates it is apparent that the plaintiff is\nthe exclusive registered proprietor of the SU-KAM marks for the\ninverter business in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999and the\nsame had been renewed on 05th October, 2008 and 09th March, 2016\nwhen the defendant no. 1 was in exclusive control and management of\nthe plaintiff-company.\n\n56.      Admittedly, till date no rectification application has been filed\nby defendant no.1 and plaintiff has spent huge amounts of money on\nexpanding its business, advertising and defending the marks by filing\nsuits.\n\n57.      The defendant no.1‚Äüs defence that though it had initially applied\nfor the mark in its name, yet the registration had been granted in\nplaintiff‚Äüs favour ‚Äócuts no ice' as the defendant no.1 was in the\nmanagement of the plaintiff company right from inception till\nappointment of resolution professional on 11th May, 2018 and during\nthis period applications for renewal of the said marks had also been\nfiled. It is pertinent to mention that even during arguments learned\nsenior counsel for defendant no.1 repeatedly emphasised that\ndefendant no.1 treated the plaintiff as his alter-ego. Consequently, the\ndefendant no.1 was all throughout aware of the aforesaid two\nregistrations as well as their renewals and as he has not challenged the\nsaid registrations till date, his right, if any, in the said marks in Class 9\nof theTrade Marks Act, 1999stands, if not extinguished, at least\nbarred by limitation.\n\n58.      Accordingly, as the aforesaid registrations are legal, valid as\nwell as subsisting and in any event as there is no challenge to themCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                             Page 47 of 77either by way of a substantive suit or a counter-claim by the defendant\nno.1, the contentions and submissions of defendant no.1 with regard to\nadoption or licensing by way of TMLA or BT Agreement and/or\ntransfer by way of Deed of Assignment are baseless, irrelevant as well\nas inconsequential and the plaintiff is the exclusive registered\nproprietor of SU-KAM marks in Class 9 of theTrade Marks Act,\n1999.\n\nAS THE LICENCE GRANTED UNDER TMLA WAS ‚ÄïNON\nTRANSFERABLE‚Äñ IN NATURE AND THERE IS NO PLEADING\nTHAT THE ERSTWHILE PARTNERSHIPS WERE ENGAGED IN\nINVERTER BUSINESS, ANY LICENCE UNDER THE TMLA COULD\nHAVE BEEN IN RESPECT OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED\nWITH THE CABLE TV BUSINESS ONLY.\n\n59.     Dehors the aforesaid fundamental reasoning, this Court finds\nthat Clause 1 of the TMLA, states that the licence granted was ‚Äïnon\ntransferable‚Äñ in nature. Clause 1 of the TMLA is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n60.     It is the defendant no.1‚Äüs case that the partnership firm, to which\nthe licence was granted, ceased to exist and the business was\ntransferred to the plaintiff. Consequently, the use of the SU-KAMCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                           Page 48 of 77marks by plaintiff is not derived from, or under any authority of\ndefendant no.1.\n\n61.   Further, proceeding on the basis that TMLA is authentic, this\nCourt is of the view that it did not apply to the plaintiff and did not\ncreate a licensor-licencee relationship between defendant no.1 and\nplaintiff as there is no reference to inverter business in the TMLA.\n\n62.   Learned senior counsel for defendant no.1 submitted across the\nbar that language in the TMLA implies inverters. However, there is no\npleading in the written statement to the effect that the erstwhile\npartnerships or defendant no.1 was engaged in inverter business and\nno evidence can be led beyond or contrary to pleadings.\n\n63.   In any event, assuming that the TMLA specifically mentioned\n‚Äïinverters‚Äñ it would then also not help defendant no.1 as defendant\nno.1 has admitted in the written statement that the two erstwhile\npartnerships were only conducting cable TV business. There is no plea\nthat they were engaged in any other business, let alone inverters.\n\n64.   It is settled law that where a mark is unregistered, as it was at\nthat stage, ownership of the proprietor is not in the trade mark, but in\nthe goodwill associated with the business where the trade mark is\nused. Since the inverter business was never carried out by the\npartnership, no goodwill was generated in favour of defendant no.1 for\nthe inverter business. Consequently, any licence under the TMLA\ncould have been a licence in respect of the goodwill associated with\nthe cable TV business only, since that was admittedly the business\nconducted by the partnership.\n\n65.   Accordingly, based on the admissions of defendant no.1 and\napplicable law, it can safely be said that the TMLA does not cover the\ninverter business and never was and is not applicable to the plaintiff.\nConsequently, no purpose will be served by leading oral evidence on\nwhether the TMLA covers the inverter business.\n\n66.   The statement in the BT Agreement relied upon by defendant\nno.1 refers to his existing ownership rights in the partnership.\nHowever, this Court is of the view that since no inverter business was\ncarried out by the partnership, there was no existing right pertaining to\nSU-KAM marks with respect to inverters. Accordingly, the statement\nin the BT Agreement could, at most, refer to ownership of the trade\nmark Su-Kam in relation to the Cable TV business. Moreover, as\nstated hereinabove, in view of the registration certificate dated 22nd\nJune, 2005 and 05th February, 2011 in favour of the plaintiff having\ncome into effect on 05th October, 1998 and 09th March, 2006\nrespectively, the contrary averment/recital in BT Agreement dated 16th\nSeptember, 1999, is of no legal consequence.\n\nTHE DEED OF ASSIGNMENT IS VOID FOR BREACH OF\nFIDUCIARY DUTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF LACK OF QUORUM\nAS THE VOTES OF DEFENDANT NO.1 AND HIS WIFE WOULD\nHAVE TO BE DISREGARDED FOR BEING INTERESTED\nDIRECTORS.\n\n67.   In the opinion of this Court, the Deed of Assignment is void for\nbreach of fiduciary duty, as it had been executed by defendant no.1,\nboth as assignor and assignee and it purports to transfer the substratum\nof plaintiff‚Äüs business to its Director (defendant no. 1) for nominal\nconsideration of Rs. 5,000/- by an alleged recordal twelve years laterCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 50 of 77and that too after commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution\nProcess!\n\n68.    The Deed of Assignment is further invalid because it contains\nstatements that the plaintiff-company is the licencee of the defendant\nno.1, which is falsified by agreement itself, which is for assignment.\nIf the assertion with respect to licence was true, the Deed/Agreement\nwould be for rectification and not for assignment by an owner!\n\n69.    The Deed of Assignment is also invalid because it portrays as if\nthe plaintiff had authorised it vide Resolution dated 20th March, 2006;\nbut the same is neither legal nor valid on account of lack of quorum\nunderSection 287of the Company Act, 1956 as the votes of two out\nof three Directors namely, defendant no.1 and his wife would have to\nbe disregarded for being beneficiaries/interested Directors by virtue ofSection 300of the Companies Act, 1956.Section 300(1)of the\nCompanies Act, 1956 states as under:-\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n70.    Moreover, Deed of Assignment is ineffective against plaintiff\nbecause it had acquired a conflicting interest in the registered trade\nmark without the knowledge of assignment or transmission as in theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 51 of 77present case between 16th March, 2006 (i.e. date of execution of Deed\nof Assignment) and 09th July 2018 (i.e. when the defendant no.1\nsubmitted the Deed of Assignment to the Interim Resolution\nProfessional), there was no assertion or representation by defendant\nno.1 that plaintiff is not the owner of the SU-KAM mark in Class 9.\nConsequently, defendant no.1 had always held out plaintiff to be the\nowner of the SU-KAM marks which the plaintiff believed to be true.\nIn view of this, defendant no.1 is estopped from contending to the\ncontrary and Mohori Bibee & Anr. Vs. Dharmodas Ghose, 7 CWN\n441 is not applicable to the present case.\n\n71.It is settled law that defendant no.1 cannot be permitted to take\nadvantage of his own breach of fiduciary duty to divest the company\nof its substratal asset as held inGlobe Motors Ltd. Vs. Mehta Teja\nSingh & Co., 1983 SCC OnLine Del 193. The relevant portion ofthe\nsaid judgmentis reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\nHe proposed that his company should undertake to place\n      them for a commission of 1-1/2 percent to the company. He\n      was held liable to account of 3-1/2 percent. In so deciding\n      Malins, V.C. made the following observations, which were\n      later on upheld by the House of Lords:--\n\n‚ÄóThus a director may be shown to be so placed and to have\n      been so closely and so long associated personally with the\n      management of the company that he will be deemed to be not\n      merely cognizant of but liable for fraud in the conduct of the\n      business of the company even though no specific act of\n      dishonesty is proved against him personally. He cannot shut\n      his eyes to what must be obvious to everyone who examines\n      the affairs of the company even superficially. If he does 50 he\n      could be held liable for dereliction of duties undertaken by\n      him and compelled to make good the losses incurred by the\n      company due to his neglect even if he is not shown to be\n      guilty of participating in the commission of fraud (emphasis\n      supplied). It is enough if his negligence is of such a character\n      as to enable frauds to be committed and losses thereby\n      incurred by the company‚Äñ. (Vide Official Liqidator v. PA.\n      Tendolkar, (1973) 43 Company Gases 382 at 384.\n\n10. A derivative action can be brought against directors who\n      are in control of the company to compel such directors to\n      account to the company for profits made by appropriating for\n      themselves a business opportunity which the company would\n      otherwise have enjoyed. (Vide Penington's Company Law 4th\n      Edition, paqe 596).\n\n11.Gower in Company Law 3rd Edition page 526 has noticed\n      that because of the trustee like position of the directors a\n      contract between the company with another firm of\n      partnership of which one of the directors was a partner have\n      been avoided at the instance of the company notwithstanding\n      that its terms were perfectly fair and that in the words of\n      Lord Cranworth L.G. ‚Äïso strictly is this principle adhered to\n      that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or\n      unfairness of a contract so entered into......‚Äñ. Thus the\n      contract will be voidable at the instance of a company and\n      any profits made by the Directors personally will be\n      recoverable by the company (page 527 supra).\n\n12. Various remedies could be resorted to by the Company in\n      case of a breach of duties by the Directors. Thus one of the\n      remedies provided to the company is recession of a contract,\n      another is accounting for profits. The liability of the Director\n      may arise out of a contract made between a director and a\n      company. In such a case accounting is a remedy additional to\n      avoidance of contract and is normally available whether or\n      not is there recession, (page 556 supra. Gower).\n\n13. A resume of the law would thus clearly show that no\n      doubt theCompanies Actdoes not forbid a contract being\n      entered into by the company with a firm in which one of the\n      Directors is a partners, it is also true that the respondent\n      Director disclosed his interest in the agreement when the\n      same was approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting\n      held on 15-6-1967. But this fact by itself does not\n      automatically prove that the arrangement which had been\n      entered into by the company was not of such a nature which\n      keeping in view the fiduciary relationship of Mehta Harnam\n      Singh, a director of the company should not have been so\n      entered into, thus giving a right to the company to avoid the\n      contract and to ask for the recovery of the profits made by\n      the Director. The test to be applied in the present case is--\n      had the company been a going concern and had some\n      payments in pursuance of this very agreement been made to\n      the respondents could the company have asked for recession\n      of the contract or in case any payments had been made to the\n      respondent Harnam Singh and others, for the return of the\n      same to the company. If the answer is in the affirmative, the\n      claim of the appellant must succeed.\n\n14. We must now turn to the examination of the agreement to\n      find out whether its terms were such which in the words of\n      the Supreme Court would show that circumstances were such\n      that there could be no other conclusion than that the same\n      was arrived at because of the peculiar position, which the\n      respondent as Director, enjoyed in the company.\n\nxxx               xxx                 xxxCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 57 of 77\n\n19. It will thus be seen that out of 13 directors who attended\n      the Board meeting on 15-6-1967, 6 of them were interested in\n      three agreements which were approved by the Board on that\n      day. Technically we may accept what is recorded in the\n      minutes of the Board that the Directors had disclosed their\n      interest in the agreement which was being approved and also\n      did not take part in the discussion or voted on the resolution.\n      Though therefore, there may not be any technical objection\n      to these resolutions yet we cannot overlook the patent\n      incongruity of accepting that unbiased mind was brought to\n      bear on the merits of these agreements when almost half of\n      the Board was interested in one or the other agreement. ‚ÄóIn\n      such a case the criticism that this was nothing but mutual\n      backslapping to enrich themselves does not sound\n      improbable. As Gower on Company Law in commenting on\n      such kind of disclosures says--‚Äóin marked contrast with the\n      basic equitable principle, the disclosure required is not to the\n      general meeting but to the board. It hardly seems over-\n      cynical to suggest that disclosure to one's cronies is a less\n      effective restraint on self seeking than disclosures to those for\n      whom one is a fiduciary.\n\nxxx                 xxx                 xxx\n\n21. The learned single Judge has not accepted that the\n      contract was without consideration. The learned Judge holds\n      that it was a service contract for the purpose of employment\n      to boost sales and because of this service there was a good\n      consideration even to paying Rs. 1 lakh 20 thousand per\n      annum as a minimum fee. Normally if a party undertakes to\n      boost sales and use his expertise for this purpose on some\n      minimum fee it is possible to say that there was a proper\n      consideration for contract. But it was theOfficial\n      Liquidator's case in reply to the application for arbitration\n      that none of these agencies including the respondents had\n      ever dealt with steel products or had any experience in the\n      line and that this device was fraudulently and collusively\n      adopted to siphen away the company's funds for the\n      individual and personal benefits of the said directors, at a\n      time when the company to their full knowledge was passingCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 58 of 77through a financial crisis beginning with July 1966. It was\n      also stated that they had not rendered any service and the\n      agreement had never been acted upon. Infact Shri B. K. Bedi,\n      the Chairman of the company who had negotiated the sales\n      originally was unable to contradict that the plaintiff firm did\n      not secure any business for the company. He also admitted\n      that the firm was not associated with any other steel unit or\n      any other manufacturing unit. He did not know that they had\n      any experience as manufacturer. The control and the\n      influence that these persons could exercise on the whole\n      Board is apparent from his admission that Directors Kirpa\n      Ram Saluja, Narinder Singh Kohli and a few other directors\n      were even on the Finance Committee of the company and this\n      committee had favoured the grant of selling agency to the\n      respondent. Thus it is crystal clear that it is a case where the\n      Board of 13 approved of these agreements, which granted the\n      distribution rights of the company's steel products to 6 of\n      themselves, of course after complying with the formality of\n      disclosing their interest. Had the presence of Directors been\n      the only objection but the terms on which the agreement was\n      entered into showed some kind of fairness and business\n      arrangement normally expected of an ordinary business man,\n      it might have been still possible to uphold the agreement. But\n      the terms incorporated in the agreement leave no manner of\n      doubt that the only interest that was kept in view was the\n      personal benefit and profit of these directors and that too at\n      great cost and to the gross detriment of the interest of the\n      company.\n\nxxx                 xxx                  xxx\n\n24. We cannot but hold the terms of the agreement dated 1-6-\n      1967 as approved by the Board were anything but to the\n      detriment of the company. This was an arrangement which\n      was made simply to siphon of Rs. 1 lakh and 20 thousand per\n      annum as a minimum fee to the Directors without doing a\n      single patch of work for the benefit of the company. This the\n      directors were able to do because of their close association\n      and control over the Board of Directors. This was not a case\n      in which only one of the directors was favoured by suchCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 59 of 77arrangement. Six of the directors out of 13 who attended the\n      meeting were the beneficiaries of the arrangement which was\n      also agreed to by the 7th member who was the chairman of\n      the company. This was a case of such blatant unfairness\n      against the company that as the Supreme Court said that it\n      would be obvious to any one who examines the affairs of the\n      company even superficially that there was not one single\n      redeeming feature in the agreement. In that view the\n      company would have been justified, had any benefit been\n      taken by the respondents to ask for the account and the\n      restoration of the amount. In the present case the\n      respondents chose to claim to have the matter referred to the\n      arbitrator. It is interesting to note that in the statement of\n      claim filed before the arbitrator the respondents have prayed\n      for a payment of Rs. 6 lakhs which is worked out at the rate\n      of 10,000/- per month for 5 years, no suggestion of having\n      done any work is even mentioned. This also would show the\n      untenable nature of the arrangement so far as the company\n      was concerned. This agreement is patently against the\n      interest and benefit of the company.\n\n25. We would, therefore, hold that this agreement was\n      vitiated and void and the official liquidator representing the\n      company is entitled to ask for its recession. As we are\n      satisfied that this agreement of 1-6-1967 which was approved\n      by the Board of Directors on 15-6-1967 was not in the\n      interest and benefit of the company the same is, therefore,\n      liable to be avoided by the Official Liquidator. In that view of\n      the matter as the agreement is held not to be subsisting,\n      being void, and as the arbitration clause forms a part of the\n      agreement will naturally not survive. The effect would be that\n      there is no existing arbitration agreement and the\n      respondents cannot ask for the matter to be referred to\n      arbitration.‚Äñ\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n72.   Consequently, the Deed of Assignment is void for breach of\nfiduciary duty.\n\nSINCE RECORDAL OF DEED OF ASSIGNMENT IS MANDATORY,\nDEFENDANT NO.1 CANNOT RELY ON THE SAID DOCUMENT\n\n73.   Assuming that the Deed of Assignment is valid, this Court is of\nthe view that recordal of the said Deed is mandatory, as held by a\nCoordinate Bench of this Court inRamaiah Life Style Cafe vs.\nEminent     Entertainment    &   Ors.,   CS(COMM)1433/2016,              as\nadmittedly the amendedSection 45of the Trade Marks Act applies to\nthe present case. In distinguishing Section 45 as it presently stands,\nfrom the pre-amendment version of Section 45, a Coordinate Bench of\nthis Court observed in the aforesaid case that non-compliance of\nmandatory requirement to record assignments would amount to\nflouting the law. It was held that any person not complying with the\nmandatory provision cannot take benefit despite such non-compliance.\nThe relevant portion ofthe said judgmentis reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\nLtd. Vs. Suresh Kumar Jasraj Burad2012 SCC OnLine Bom\n      438 has held that though prior to the amendment registration\n      of assignment under Section 45 could not be said to be a\n      mere formality but is so after the amendment.\n\n22. One thing which is however clear as a day light on a\n      reading of Section 45 is that registration of assignment under\n      Section 45 is mandatory. This is evident from the use of the\n      word ‚ÄûShall‚Äü in Section 45(1).\n\n23. Thus it is mandatory for a assignee of a registered trade\n      mark to apply in the prescribed manner to the Registrar,\n      Trade Marks to register his title thereto.\n\n24. Seen in this light what distinguishes the present case fromSun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limitedsupra and the\n      judgments relied upon therein is that while in all those cases\n      the plaintiff had applied to the Registrar, Trade Marks for\n      registration of his title to the trade mark by assignment or\n      transmission and non-registration was not attributable to any\n      default on the part of the plaintiff therein, the plaintiff herein\n      for the last nearly eight years from the date of the claimed\n      assignment and for the last nearly five years since the\n      admitted knowledge of claimed infringement has not even\n      applied to the Registrar of the Trade Marks for registering\n      the assignment of trade mark in its favour. The possibility of\n      the plaintiff not doing so for reasons not spelled out before\n      this Court cannot be ruled out. The fact that the plaintiff has\n      not chosen to make M/s Ramaiah Developers & Builders (P)\n      Ltd. as a party to this suit also raises doubt as to the validity\n      of the assignment, on the basis whereof this suit for\n      infringement has been filed.\n\n25. Even otherwise, I am of the opinion that if this Court\n      inspite of such delays and neglect on the part of the plaintiff\n      grants to the plaintiff all the benefits and privileges to which\n      a registered proprietor is entitled to, the same would amountCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 64 of 77to this Court allowing mandatory provisions of the statute to\n      be flouted and/or not penalising the plaintiff therefor, making\n      the statutory provisions otiose.‚Äñ\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n74.   Consequently, defendant no.1 cannot rely on a document that\nwas mandatory to register. Further, inSun Pharmaceuticals\nIndustries Limited(supra) application for recordal was filed in 2000\nfor a 1998 assignment and delay in recordal was by the trade marks\nregistry, whereas in the present case the application for recordal is\nmade after more than twelve years, after commencement of Corporate\nInsolvency Resolution Process, on 18th July, 2018.\n\nDEFENDANT NO.1 IS ESTOPPED FROM LEADING EVIDENCE\nOF HIS TITLE TO THE SU-KAM MARKS IN RESPECT OF CLASS 9,\nIN VIEW OF HIS REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE PLAINTIFF IS\nTHE EXCLUSIVE OWNER.\n\n75.   This Court is also of the opinion that defendant no.1 is estopped\nfrom leading evidence of his title to the SU-KAM marks in respect of\nClass 9, in view of his representations to the plaintiff and the world at\nlarge that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner, on which plaintiff had\nrelied by expanding its business and by spending money on\nadvertisements and promoting its business under the impugned mark.\n\n76.   In fact, just seven days before the Deed of Assignment plaintiff\napplied for registration of mark (i.e. on 09th March, 2006) and just\nfifteen days after, defendant no.1 held out to plaintiff and Reliance\nIndia Power Fund (i.e. on 31st March, 2006) that the company was the\nowner of the trade mark in question. Though the Share SubscriptionCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 65 of 77Cum Shareholders Agreement gives status of trademarks and\nregistrations in an annexure being Exhibit H as on 27th February,\n2006, yet the covenant in the said Agreement dated 31st March, 2006\nclearly stipulates that all products and names listed in Exhibit H are\nowned and held by the plaintiff company and ‚ÄïAll rights to\nIntellectual Property are owned exclusively by the Company\n(Plaintiff), free and clear of any encumbrances, and no other person\nhas any right or interest in or license to use or right to license others\nto use any of them.‚Äñ\n\n77.   In any event, the SU-KAM marks with respect to inverters in\nClass 9 of theTrade Marks Act, 1999were subsequently renewed by\nthe plaintiff-company on 05th October, 2008 and 09th March, 2016\nwhen defendant no. 1 was in its control and management.\n\n78.   A suit had also been filed in 2015 for infringement of the SU-\nKAM marks by the plaintiff when the defendant no.1 was the\nManaging Director of the plaintiff company and held more than eighty\nper cent of its shares.    In the said suit, filed under the aegis of\ndefendant no.1, plaintiff was identified as the owner of the SU-KAM\nmarks. Plaintiff then under the exclusive management and control of\ndefendant no.1 had averred in the said plaint, ‚ÄïThe plaintiff was the\nfirst company in India that started a system for power backup in\nIndia....the products launched by the plaintiff under the mark SU-\nKAM have acquired a high degree of distinctiveness in the country\ndue to continuous, extensive and popular use since a long\nuninterrupted period of more than 25 years making it a well-known\nmark. Resultantly, the mark SU-KAM is today perceived by theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                         Page 66 of 77general public as well as by members of the trade as originating from\nplaintiff and no one else. It is submitted that by virtue of the\naforementioned long, continuous and extensive use of the trademark\nSU-KAM and other related trademarks with the aforesaid trademark\nregistrations for the same in favour of plaintiff, plaintiff has acquired\nboth common law rights as well as statutory rights over exclusive use\nof the mark SU-KAM‚Äñ.\n\n79.      If the erstwhile partnerships had commenced the inverter\nbusiness and defendant no.1 was resultantly the owner of the SU-\nKAM trade mark for inverters, these statements could not have been\nmade.\n\n80.      Further, when defendant no.1 submitted his bid for the plaintiff\ncompany during the ongoing insolvency proceedings, he had relied\nupon a brand valuation report dated 03rd March, 2015 undertaken by\nErnst and Young which identified plaintiff-company to be the owner\nof the SU-KAM marks.\n\n81.      The Supreme Court inB.L. Sreedhar & Ors. Vs. K.M.\nMunireddy & Ors., (2003) 2 SCC 355 has held that if a man either by\nwords or by his conduct intimates that he consents to an act, he cannot\nquestion the legality of the act to the prejudice of those who have so\ngiven faith to his words or to the fair inference to be drawn from his\nconduct.The relevant portion ofB.L. Sreedhar(supra) is reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n\n13, para 448) The rule on the subject is thus laid down by Lord\n   Denman, in Pickard v. Sears [(1837) 6 Ad & El 469 : 112 ER 179]\n   Ad & E at p. 474: ER p. 181\n\n         ‚ÄïBut the rule of law is clear, that, where one by his words or\n      conduct wilfully causes another to believe the existence of a\n      certain state of things, and induces him to act on that belief, so\n      as to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded\n      from averring against the latter a different state of things as\n      existing at the same time;‚Äñ\n\n          ‚ÄïThe whole doctrine of estoppel of this kind, which is a\n      fictitious statement treated as true, might have been founded in\n      reason, but I am not sure that it was. There is another kind of\n      estoppel -- estoppel by representation -- which is founded upon\n      reason and it is founded upon decision also.‚Äñ Per Jessel, M.R.\n      in General Finance & Co. v. Liberator [(1878) 10 Ch D 15 :\n\n82.   Consequently, defendant no.1 is estopped from contending that\nhe is the owner of SU-KAM marks in respect of Class 9 of theTrade\nMarks Act, 1999.\n\nBETWEEN 16TH MARCH, 2006 (I.E. DATE OF EXECUTION OF\nDEED OF ASSIGNMENT) AND 09TH JULY 2018 (I.E. WHEN THE\nDEFENDANT NO.1 SUBMITTED THE DEED OF ASSIGNMENT TO\nTHE INTERIM RESOLUTION PROFESSIONAL), THERE WAS NO\nASSERTION BY DEFENDANT NO.1 THAT PLAINTIFF IS NOT THE\nOWNER OF THE SU-KAM MARK IN CLASS 9. ACCORDINGLY,\nTHE PRESENT SUIT IS WITHIN LIMITATION.\n\n83.Article 58of theLimitation Act, 1963, states that the limitation\nperiod for obtaining any other declaration is three years, ‚Äïwhen the\nright to sue first accrues‚Äñ.\n\n84.   The Apex Court inKhatri Hotels Private Limited & Anr. vs.\nUnion of India & Anr., (2011) 9 SCC 126 while interpretingArticle\n58of theLimitation Act, 1963, relied on earlier judgments interpreting\nsimilarArticle 120of the Limitation Act, 1908. The relevant portion\nofthe said judgmentreads as under:-\n\n29.InRukhmabai v. Lala Laxminarayanthe three-Judge\n      Bench noticed the earlier judgments and summed up the legal\n      position in the following words:\n\nThe said cause of action again arose in favour of the plaintiff on 18 th\nJuly, 2018 when defendant no.1 relying upon the alleged Deed of\nAssignment applied for recordal of assignment with the Trade Mark\nRegistry.\n\n89.   Accordingly, the present suit is within limitation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n90.   To reiterate, the intent behind incorporating the summary\njudgment procedure in theCommercial Court Act, 2015is to ensure\ndisposal of commercial disputes in a time-bound manner. In fact, the\napplicability ofOrder XIIIA, CPCto commercial disputes,\ndemonstrates that the trial is no longer the default procedure/norm.\n\n91.   Rule 3 ofOrder XIIIA, CPC, as applicable to commercial\ndisputes, empowers the Court to grant a summary judgement against\nthe defendant where the Court considers that the defendant has no realCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 73 of 77prospects of successfully defending the claim and there is no other\ncompelling reason why the claim should not be disposed of before\nrecording of oral evidence. The expression ‚Äïreal‚Äñ directs the Court to\nexamine whether there is a ‚Äïrealistic‚Äñ as opposed to ‚Äïfanciful‚Äñ\nprospects of success. This Court is of the view that the expression ‚Äïno\ngenuine issue requiring a trial‚Äñ in Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure\nand ‚Äïno other compelling reason.....for trial‚Äñ inCommercial Courts\nActcan be read mutatis mutandis. Consequently,Order XIIIA, CPCwould be attracted if the Court, while hearing such an application, can\nmake the necessary finding of fact, apply the law to the facts and the\nsame is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means of\nachieving a fair and just result.\n\n92.   Accordingly, unlike ordinary suits, Courts need not hold trial in\ncommercial suits, even if there are disputed questions of fact as held\nby the Canadian Supreme Court in Robert Hryniak (supra), in the\nevent, the Court comes to the conclusion that the defendant lacks a\nreal prospect of successfully defending the claim.\n\n93.   The present suit is within limitation as the right to sue accrues\nwhen there is a clear and/or unequivocal threat proceeding from the\ndefendant which invades or jeopardises the plaintiff‚Äüs rights. In the\npresent case between 16th March, 2006 (i.e. date of execution of Deed\nof Assignment) and 09th July 2018 (i.e. when the defendant no.1\nsubmitted the Deed of Assignment to the interim resolution\nprofessional), there was no assertion by defendant no.1 that the\nplaintiff is not the owner of the SU-KAM marks in Class 9.\n\nConsequently, the cause of action for filing the present suit arose for\nthe first time on 09th July, 2018.\n\n94.     In the present case, the plaintiff is the exclusive registered\nproprietor of the trademarks SU-KAM with respect to inverters which\nfall within Class 9 in view of the registration certificates dated 22 nd\nJune, 2005 and 05th February, 2011 in favour of the plaintiff having\ncome into effect on 05th October, 1998 and 09th March, 2006\nrespectively and which were renewed on 05th October, 2008 and 09th\nMarch, 2016 - when admittedly defendant no.1 was in control and\nmanagement of the plaintiff-company. Consequently, the defendant\nno.1‚Äüs contentions and submissions with regard to earlier adoption or\nlicensing by way of TMLA dated 07th July, 1995 or BT Agreement\ndated 16th September, 1999 and/or subsequent transfer by way of Deed\nof    Assignment      dated   16th   March,   2006   are   baseless     and\ninconsequential.\n\n95.     Further the Deed of Assignment is void for breach of fiduciary\nduty. In fact, the said Deed had been executed by the defendant no.1\nboth as assignor and assignee and it purports to transfer the substratum\nof plaintiff‚Äüs business to its director ‚Äïdefendant no.1‚Äñ for nominal\nconsideration of Rs.5,000/- by an alleged recordal twelve years\nlater and that too after commencement of corporate insolvency\nresolution process!\n\n96.In view of judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court inRamaiah Life Style Cafe(supra) as the Deed of Assignment has not\nbeen registered/recorded, the defendant no.1 cannot rely upon the\nsame.\n\n97.   The said deed is also invalid on account of lack of quorum\nundersection 287of the Company Act, 1956 as the votes of two out of\nthree directors namely, defendant no.1 and his wife would have to be\ndisregarded for being beneficiaries/interested directors by virtue ofsection 300of the Companies Act, 1956.InGlobe Motors Ltd.(supra), a Division Bench of this Court has held that a director cannot\nbe permitted to take advantage of his own breach of fiduciary duty to\ndivest the company of its substratal asset.\n\n98.   The defendant no. 1 is also estopped from leading evidence of\nhis title to the SU-KAM marks in respect of Class 9, in view of the\nrepresentations [in particular the applications for registration of the\nsaid marks dated 5th October, 1998, 9th March, 2006, as well as\napplications for renewal of marks dated 5th October, 2008 and 9th\nMarch, 2016, the Shares Subscription-cum-Shareholders Agreement\nwith Reliance India Power Fund dated 31st March, 2006, a suit for\ninfringement of SU-KAM marks filed in 2015 before this Court and a\nBrand Valuation Report by Ernst & Young dated 03rd March, 2015 -\nwhen defendant no. 1 was in management and control of the plaintiff-\ncompany and held more than 80 per cent of its shares] to the world at\nlarge that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner on which representations\nthe plaintiff relied by expanding its business and by spending money\non advertisements as well as promoting its business under the\nimpugned marks.\n\n99.   Consequently, the admissions of defendant no.1 in documents\nand pleadings prevent him from taking factual positions to the\ncontrary and leading evidence to the contrary.       Further from theCS(COMM) 1155/2018                                        Page 76 of 77pleadings and material on record, it is apparent that the defendants\nhave no real prospect of defending the allegations made by the\nplaintiff and there is no compelling reason for trial.\n\n100. Keeping in view the aforesaid findings and mandate of law,\npresent suit is decreed in accordance with prayers (a) to (f) of the\namended prayer clause, but without any order as to costs. All pending\napplications also stand disposed of.\n\n101.   Registry is directed to prepare the decree sheet accordingly.\n\nMANMOHAN, J\nOCTOBER 30, 2019\njs/rn/KACS(COMM) 1155/2018                                          Page 77 of 77"

    "content": "Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev built his company's fortune by cashing in on an unreliable power grid. Now, he's looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit\n\nWhen he turned 15, Kunwer Sachdev began helping his older brother sell pens to shops in Delhi. It was the late 1970s, and the nation‚Äôs capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India‚Äôs largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices‚Äîwhich he didn‚Äôt have access to when he was growing up‚Äîthat provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.Power outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world‚Äôs population, don‚Äôt have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.These days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs promise of replicating Gujarat‚Äôs 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It‚Äôs also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit.Su-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.‚ÄúWe started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don‚Äôt have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I‚Äôm already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,‚Äù says Sachdev.He may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. ‚ÄúWe started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,‚Äù he says.Su-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.Su-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche.

Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology.

It was the late 1970s, and the nation‚Äôs capital was not immune to rolling blackouts, which increased in frequency during the sweltering summer months. Today, at the age of 52, Sachdev is the founder and chief executive officer of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, one of India‚Äôs largest back-up power companies. It manufactures inverters and other devices‚Äîwhich he didn‚Äôt have access to when he was growing up‚Äîthat provide uninterrupted power supply so that electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans can function when the grid fails to deliver.Power outages are still very much a part of life in India, including Delhi. In its most recent study, the World Bank reported that over 1.2 billion people, or 20 percent of the world‚Äôs population, don‚Äôt have access to electricity, of which more than 400 million live in India. For companies like Su-Kam that benefit when the lights go off, business has never been better. Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues for 2013-14 stand at Rs 1,200 crore, up by 20 percent from 2012-13.These days, though, Sachdev has been paying close attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs promise of replicating Gujarat‚Äôs 24-hour power supply model across the whole of India. And industry analysts believe that this goal can be achieved over the next five to 10 years. It‚Äôs also why the first-generation entrepreneur, who attributes his success to his ability to plan for future needs, is looking up to the sun for inspiration‚Äîand profit.Su-Kam is betting on individual home owners generating solar power to reduce their electricity bills. The majority of consumers currently plug inverters and UPS batteries to their appliances, which then charge and hoard power from the main grid. Sachdev has flipped this model: He has started manufacturing inverters and UPS devices that can draw power from solar panels, which Su-Kam began manufacturing in 2004.‚ÄúWe started research and development [R&D] for regular inverters in 2000. We don‚Äôt have to do anything special for solar-powered products. I‚Äôm already dealing in batteries, which use direct current [DC]. Solar panels also use DC. All I have to do is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar powered one,‚Äù says Sachdev.He may not have an engineering degree, but he knows the nuts and bolts of the technology Su-Kam is betting on. ‚ÄúWe started manufacturing solar-powered products a decade ago, and today it accounts for 20 percent of our sales,‚Äù he says.Su-Kam offers solar solutions for homes and businesses. Apart from solar panels and hybrid UPS devices, it manufactures solar batteries, inverters, home lighting systems and network management systems. Sachdev wants to decentralise the power generating process. Instead of setting up large projects (more than 25 MW) that harness sunlight and sell electricity to the government‚Äôs central power grid, Su-Kam is selling smaller 5 kilowatts (KW) to 1 MW solar-powered systems to villages and housing complexes.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell to the government, which involves sourcing land to generate the required 25-30 MW of power. Here, the customer provides the land and we provide the technology,‚Äù says Sachdev. ‚ÄúWhatever the solar unit produces will get ‚Äòmixed‚Äô into the customer‚Äôs normal power supply because of which a household‚Äôs bill will reduce. You recover the investment in a few years, and the burden on the government to generate more power is lessened.‚ÄùSachdev‚Äôs solar solutions plans are intriguing because they form a sort of hybrid between completely decentralised solutions such as individual solar lanterns and large solar farms.\n\nSu-Kam is still in the pilot phase of this project. Since the start of 2014, the company has installed solar products‚Äîwhich provide eight to 10 hours of power supply daily‚Äîin 1 lakh homes across India. And it says that exports to more than 70 countries account for 15 percent of its sales (both regular and solar-powered devices). ‚ÄúWe have a presence in African nations, but we are seeing that the highest demand for solar products is in India itself,‚Äù says Sachdev. This is why he has scaled up R&D in solar products at his Gurgaon facility. Five years ago, barely two out of the 45-strong team of engineers researched this sector. Today, it has evolved into a unit of 15 engineers.Ashish Sethi, who heads Su-Kam‚Äôs solar business, recalls how, a few months ago, the R&D team produced a one-off (not in the company‚Äôs catalogue) solar product as per the specifications of a customer in Uttar Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe did it in 48 hours,‚Äù says Sethi who believes that by 2018, Su-Kam‚Äôs solar arm will grow from its present Rs 250 crore business to a Rs 700 crore one. The company, however, has had its fair share of problems. An industry analyst who did not want to be named told Forbes India that Su-Kam was hit by quality and service issues three years ago. ‚ÄúPeripheral competitors like Exide and V-Guard also stole market share,‚Äù says the analyst. Two years ago, profits lagged and Sachdev fired 400 members of the service staff.Sachdev acknowledges Su-Kam‚Äôs not-so-stellar performance in 2011.¬† ‚ÄúWe realised that we were starting to fall apart because we had too many people and no systems or structures. When we got major external funding, my people wasted a lot. I was also part of that,‚Äù he says. Apart from developing the solar business, creating a solid management and hiring system is an important part of his agenda.He‚Äôs refreshingly candid about the mistakes he‚Äôs made. Perhaps it‚Äôs a sign of an entrepreneur who is not burdened by investor expectations. Though Reliance Capital and Temasek Holdings picked up a combined 20 percent stake for Rs 45 crore in 2006, they seldom interfere with operations. His investors trust him, he says. ‚ÄúFew companies have done all the groundwork necessary to reap the benefits in the next five years,‚Äù says Amitabh Mohanty, head of debt strategies at Reliance Capital (of the ADAG stable).That said, eight years is a long time in private equity circles and investors will be waiting (and hoping) for the solar business to take off so that they can make a profitable exit. Success will depend on whether a company can stay relevant to India‚Äôs evolving power needs. And Sachdev believes he‚Äôs on the right track.He wants to be seen as a social entrepreneur delivering clean energy to villagers. But he‚Äôs also a businessman, one who knows what it‚Äôs like to be bound to the whims of a capricious power grid. If Su-Kam can find a model to deliver and service solar generators to clusters of homes (particularly in rural areas), it can provide light and improve their standard of living by powering fans, televisions, mobile devices, and so on.Like many of the customers he wants to reach out to, Sachdev, the son of a railway clerk who went to a Hindi-medium government school, hails from a lower-middleclass family. His is the quintessential rags-to-riches story. While helping his brother build a writing instruments business, Sachdev graduated from Hindu College in 1984 with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in statistics. He later parted ways with his brother and got a law degree from Delhi University.Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he set up Su-Kam‚Äîa cable TV accessories company‚Äîin Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh in 1988 with Rs 10,000. The fact that he didn‚Äôt have an engineering degree did not deter him. He picked the right business and, by 1998, the cable TV sector in India was booming. Sachdev says he was making a tidy Rs 3-4 crore as annual turnover.But 1998 was also a turning point for the entrepreneur and, by extension, for Su-Kam. Power cuts were a frequent occurrence, and he recalls that the inverter in his house kept breaking down. He started researching the business and found that it was a largely unorganised industry. He also realised that it was an untapped sector, primed for growth in keeping with India‚Äôs accelerated development at the time.In two years, he moved away from the cable TV industry and began developing and manufacturing inverters. In 2002, Su-Kam‚Äôs revenues stood at Rs 10 crore, and by 2004 they had grown to Rs 100 crore. It may have taken Sachdev just two years to grow Su-Kam tenfold but, after 2004, as the industry became more organised, it took him a decade to grow another tenfold. Also, it‚Äôs hardly the only inverter company to make the logical move to solar.In 1991, when Su-Kam was still selling cable TV accessories, businessman and engineer Rakesh Malhotra‚Äôs Luminous Power Technologies started manufacturing its first inverters. In 2011, Malhotra sold a 74 percent stake in Luminous Power Technology to European giant Schneider Electric for Rs 1,400 crore. It is now a leader in the Rs 8,000 crore Indian inverter and UPS market (by revenues) with Taiwanese-owned Microtek in the second place, followed by Su-Kam. In 2011, Luminous also launched solar products, which brought in 10 percent of revenues in 2013.Although Sethi claims that Su-Kam is a leader in the solar UPS business, experts say it‚Äôs not easy to verify this claim because the green energy sector is fragmented and niche. Most of the companies operating in this arena are either unlisted or subsidiaries of multinationals, and data is hard to come by. Sachdev is wary yet respectful of competition. ‚ÄúPeople think Schneider bought Luminous for the brand; they bought it for the technology.

    "content": "His entrepreneurial experience is extensive and diverse, from selling pens and stationery to working in the sales department to completely reimagining the Indian inverter market. One of our generation's greatest innovators, marketers, motivational speakers, and visionary business people is Kunwer Sachdeva, founder of Su-Kam Power Systems, India's leading power solutions provider.\n\nLearning the ropes\n\nDespite originating from a lower middle-class household, Sachdeva overcame his financial challenges to start his first business at 15. Being a visionary, Kunwer quickly predicted the expansion of the power backup market in India and decided to close his cable TV company in 1998 to launch Su-Kam Power Systems. Su-Kam, originally a startup, is now an Indian multinational corporation and is regarded as one of the 500 India Inc.'s fastest-growing companies. On November 16, 1962, Kunwer Sachdev was born into a middle-class family. He did schooling in a public school in Delhi's Punjabi Bagh. He was one of the three sons of an Indian Railways department officer. With Sachdev's help, his brother established a small business selling writing utensils. Sachdev earned his LLB from Delhi University after graduating from Hindu College with a degree in statistics.\n\nHe is in charge of Su-R&D Kam's department and the company's general business. The Indian power backup industry's first patent applications for technology and design, which Sachdeva made. Additionally, he has been recognized for creating the first plastic-body inverters, which India Today named \"Innovation of the Decade.\" By incorporating cutting-edge technology like MOSFET, Microcontroller based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters, Kunwer revolutionized the power backup sector. He also gave India a \"Home UPS\" device that incorporated an inverter and a UPS into a single piece of hardware. Kunwer challenged the entire industry to become an organized sector because, before Su-debut, Kam's inverter market was dominated by hundreds of local firms selling inferior products.\n\nWalkabout Entreprenership\n\nHe was so passionate about generating green energy that he desired to do it throughout India. Ten years ago, it was predicted that solar energy technology would usher in a revolution. Their home-related solar technologies include Solar (home appliance converters to solar inverter) and Brainy (first Hybrid Solar Home UPS). He has also looked into solar devices, from modest home remote controls to significant companies. Additionally, he has made a significant contribution to the creation of Unique Solar DC Systems. After Kunwar's diligent work, Su-kam is able to capture the largest market share. The current objective of good work is to supply solar energy to each and every home in India.\n\nSu-Kam currently produces over 250 products, including solar goods, UPSs, batteries, and specialised solar solutions. Su-Kam is a well-known \"Make in India\" brand with over 75,000 channel partners in numerous nations. The company's operations have already reached approximately 90 nations, thanks largely to Sachdev, who helped the corporation dominate the power markets in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe Journey so far\n\nIt would be the term used to describe the experience with Su-Kam. How often have I learned and unlearned management principles, interpersonal communication techniques, and life principles? It's more challenging to master unlearning than learning. You frequently become so firmly committed to your beliefs that you lose sight of reality.

    "content": "Gurugram-based entrepreneur Kunwer Sachdev has found a place among 6th Hurun‚Äôs Most Respected Entrepreneurs‚Äô 2017. The‚ÄúMost Respected Entrepreneurs‚Äùis the highest honour awarded by Hurun Report annually that estimates the influence of Indian entrepreneurs over the year. The objective of the initiative is to promote entrepreneurship in India which is one of the hottest markets after the US and China. The Hurun Report has won numerous awards for their ground-breaking lists. Hurun awards were held on December 14 in Worli, Mumbai.\n\nFounder and Managing Director of Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, India‚Äôs largest power solutions company Kunwer Sachdev was honoured for his exemplary contribution to the Indian solar and power backup industry. Among the other dignitaries honoured on the occasion were Dr Cyrus S Poonawala, Serum Institute India, Adi Godrej, Godrej Industries, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Biocon, Byju Raveendran, and Byju‚Äôs, Abhishek Lodha, Lodha Group, Rana Kapoor, Yes Bank and the like.\n\nThe Hurun Most Respected Entrepreneur Award was first established in 1999. This annual award focuses on two growing economies China and India. The Award is set up to recognize the success stories of entrepreneurs and talk about their stories on a global platform.Founded by Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report is a luxury publisher group. It currently has offices in London, Mumbai, Shanghai and LA. Hurun Report India is piloted by Anas Rahman Junaid, MD& Chief Researcher. Its objective is to promote the success stories of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs on global platforms\n\n‚ÄúI am honoured to receive this distinction. It has been an arduous yet memorable journey. I would also like to thank all my mentors, well-wishers and friends who have been a part of this incredible journey.‚Äù said Kunwer Sachdev.\n\nPopularly known as the ‚ÄòInverter Man of India‚Äô, Sachdev was the firsthttps://buyxenical120.comentrepreneur to file patents for technology and design in the Indian power backup industry. He is also credited with inventing world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter which has been declared as ‚ÄòInnovation of the Decade‚Äô. Kunwer revolutionized the power backup industry by introducing world-class technologies such as MOSFET, Microcontroller based and DSP Sine Wave into inverters. He also gave ‚ÄòHome UPS‚Äô to India which combined the features of UPS and inverter into single equipment.\n\nAnas Rahman Junaid Managing Director and Chief Researcher of Hurun Report India said, ‚ÄúChina and India are the two economies that will lead the world in the next 10 to 20 years. Hurun has been in China for the last 20 years and we have seen how the Chinese entrepreneurs have grown and come of age. We do see a similar pattern in India. So, this award is really about how we are going to achieve that kind of growth story in India. By identifying the patterns in China, we look at those entrepreneurs in India who have contributed in a similar fashion.‚Äù\n\nHailing from a lower-middle-class family background, Sachdev never let financial constraints bar him from becoming a serial entrepreneur. He started off by selling pens on cycle with his older brother at a tender age of 15 years. He later founded a profitable business of cable TV communications in Delhi.\n\nBeing a visionary, Kunwer was quick to foresee the growth of power backup industry in India and decided to shut down his cable TV business in 1998.He then established Su-Kam Power Systems limited by renting a factory in DLF phase IV which turned out to be lucky for him. Now headquartered in Udyog Vihar phase IV Su-Kam manufactures more than 250 products including various solar products, UPS, batteries, and customized solar solutions.A successful example of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, Su-Kam has over 75,000 channel partners in many countries around the world. Sachdev has been instrumental in expanding company‚Äôs operations to almost 90 countries worldwide and capturing the power market in Africa and Asia.\n\nSachdev is credited with catapulting Su-Kam to the top league of companies in its category within a short span of a few years. Once a startup, Su-Kam, is now an Indian Multinational Corporation, and is recognized as one of the fastest growing organization among the India Inc. 500.\n\nType above and pressEnterto search.

    "date": "Dec 13, 2017",
    "content": "Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd. is India's largest power solutions company which has a presence in 90 countries worldwide and holds a record for being the only company in this field to file for over 120 patents. It manufactures more than 250 products including various solar products, UPS, batteries, and customized solar solutions. It has over 50,000 channel partners in many countries around the world. In a t√™te-√†-t√™te with Kunwer Sachdev, Managing Director, Su-Kam, we discussed the biggest challenges for the industry and also the growth path of Su-Kam for the coming year.\n\nYou have around 75000+ channel partners. How do you choose your franchisees/distribution partners? Any specific criteria?There are no specific criteria for selection of channel partners. Any individual having a desire to work in the solar segment and willingness to promote the solar industry can become our channel partner. Also, the distribution network varies from place to place according to the geography, dynamics and needs of the customers.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges for your industry and how do you plan to overcome them?The solar industry, at present, faces a potent threat from cheap Chinese products. One of the major reasons why low -quality Chinese solar products have penetrated Indian market is the low cost of Chinese modules. They are 10-20 percent priced lower than their Indian counterparts. However, this is only one side of a coin. Most of us are unaware of the fact that Chinese products are of far inferior quality than that of India and can cause our appliances to malfunction. Moreover, Chinese companies indulge in misrepresentation of facts and do not provide any assurance about the lifecycle of the product. ¬†We at Su-Kam, are fully geared to overcome this challenge through our state-of ‚Äìthe- art products which are a successful example of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô and are designed to make lives comfortable and hassle-free for customers.\n\nHow important it is today to have patents in a distribution and franchise business?Su-Kam has a unique distinction of filing over 120 patents. It is important to have patents to keep in check unethical practices on the part of Chinese manufacturers and other competitors. Filing patents also helps to maintain the top-notch quality of work that we are doing.\n\nWhat are your comments on India‚Äôs solar Industry? Do you think there is a lot of need for proper awareness?Although the government has taken a slew of initiatives to promote solar energy, a lot more needs to be done to educate people about its benefits. Su-Kam is playing an instrumental role in inculcating awareness among people about solar energy. To this effect, the company organizes solar training workshops across the country. It is in line with government‚Äôs ambitious target of preparing a skilled and industry -ready workforce to fulfill the target of 100000 MW of solar power by 2022. Su-Kam has also established a Centre for Smart Solar Energy at Manav Rachna University in 2016. Keeping in mind that an educational institute is a perfect place for conducting training that will help youth to explore alternate sources of energy, the centre has been provided with state-of-the-art equipment and witnesses a flurry of activities related to instrumentation, control and optimization of various energy systems. We also have a dedicated Youtube channel geared to promote solar education. It has over 30,000 subscribers.\n\nWhat stringent steps are you taking for quality check?Equipped with state-of- the- art technology, Su-Kam‚Äôs products greatly enhance the comfort level of customers. Top- notch quality is the key highlight of Su-Kam‚Äôs products. Our products are in line with global quality standards. All our products go through a series of quality checks. Firstly, all of them are manually checked in the product line. Then, they are checked through automated machines. Finally, about 10-15% of the products are picked randomly to go through the entire process once again.\n\nYour expansion plans for coming year?We are making highly efficient solar products that will reduce the return on investment we are providing solutions that can convert normal inverters to a solar inverter at a very low cost. At the same time, our grid tie inverters will not only fulfill the energy requirements of the home where they are installed but they will be able to feed power back to the grid hence enabling earnings as well. Solar along with storage will be the next big thing worldwide, so Su-Kam will be a company selling power rather than selling products. We are also supporting all initiatives by the government towards promoting solar energy and we wish to grow along with the solar industry.\n\nTop 3 tips to be successful in a solar franchise businessMy advice would be to follow your passion because when one does that, he is able to come up with products and services that are worthwhile and able to leave a mark in the market. The sole aim should never be creating only the valuation for the company. Instead, focus on creating value through your product, rest will follow.\n\nFor hassle-free instant subscription, just give your number and email id and our\r\n                    customer care agent will get in touch with you\n\norClick here to Subscribe Online\n\nThank you for subscribing.

However, due to ongoing\n                          disputes and quarrels, the parties have been living separately since\n                          September 2009 and have not been able to reconcile their differences.\n\n4.       The petitioner and respondent No. 2 jointly filed a Petition under\n                          Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (\"HMA,1955\" hereinafter)\n                          before the Family Court, New Delhi. They entered into a Settlement and it\n                          was agreed that the Petitioner would pay a settlement amount of Rs.\n                          5,00,00,000/- and transfer complete rights, titles, and ownership of two\n                          immovable properties: one commercial property bearing No. WZ- 1402/1,\n                          Nangal Raya, Delhi-110046, and another residential property bearing No. F-\n                          37, Greenwood City, Gurgaon, Haryana in favour of Respondent No. 2.\n\n5.       The parties accepted the Settlement Deed dated 13.08.2015 in their\n                          respective statements and first motion of divorce under Section 13B(1) of\n                          the HMA, 1955 was allowed by the Order dated 14.08.2015.\n\n6.       In furtherance of the Settlement Deed, parties signed two addendum\n                          Agreements both dated 11.03.2016. The first Addendum Agreement was e-\n                          stamped at 6:46 PM and the second was e- stamped on 11.03.2016 at 6:48\n                          PM. There were thus, two Addendum Agreements signed on the same day e-\n                          stamped at a gap of two minutes.\n\n7. The second Addendum Agreement was presented before the Family Court\n                          in the second Petition for Divorce under Section 13(B)(2) of HMA wherein\n                          parties made their detailed statements endorsing the second Addendum\n                          Agreement and also deposed about the details of the Settlement. The\n                          statements were accepted and it was mentioned in the Order dated\n                          11.03.2016 that full and final settlement amount of Rs. 3 crores has been\n                          received by the respondent No. 2. The Divorce by Mutual Consent under\n                          Section 13(B)(2) of HMA, 1955 was accordingly given to the parties.\n\n8.    The petitioner has claimed that during the Divorce proceedings, he\n                          was unable to retrieve the cheques issued to respondent No. 2 in pursuance\n                          of the first Addendum. However, these cheques were wrongly deposited by\n                          her despite there being no underlying liability. In light of the final Second\n                          Addendum Agreement, she ought to have returned the cheques. But she has\n                          manipulated the facts to her advantage in order to coerce the petitioner and\n                          to extract more money.\n\n9. The respondent No. 2 filed a Complaint under Section 138 of the\n                          Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the Petitioner for dishonour of\n                          above-mentioned       cheques   vide    Complaint     case    bearing        no.\n                          NACT/10395/2016 and NACT/10396/2016 which are pending adjudication\n                          before Hon‚Äüble Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram.\n\n10. The respondent No.2 has also filed a Civil Suit (Original Side) bearing\n                          No. 398/2019 under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\n                          seeking recovery of Rs. 4,05,00,000/- along with pendent lite and future\n                          interest @12% p.a..\n\n11.   Additionally, at the behest of Respondent No. 2, the distinguished\n                          Publication houses, Times of India and The Hindu, published defamatory\n\nArticles   concerning   the   Petitioner.   The   Petitioner   submitted      his\n                          representation to these publication houses requesting them for the removal\n                          of the Articles.\n\n12.   The petitioner has claimed that the present Complaint Case bearing\n                          No. 2086/2024 under Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 was yet\n                          another attempt by respondent No.2 to harass the petitioner. The respondent\n                          No. 2 by relying on the first Addendum read with the final Settlement, has\n                          sought to portray the petitioner has committed criminal breach of trust and\n                          cheating. She has concealed the second Addendum entered into between the\n                          parties. Moreover, he has impleaded Smt. Khushboo Sachdev, the second\n                          wife of the petitioner in the impugned F.I.R., even though she has no\n                          concern with any of this controversy.\n\n13.   The petitioner exhausted by the continuous harassment and hoping to\n                          achieve peace, the Petitioner paid the Respondent No. 2 Rs. 5,00,000/- on\n                          28.12.2022 and an additional Rs. 2,00,000/- on 21.02.2023, over and above\n                          the already paid settlement amount.\n\n14.   The petitioner has claimed that he has been dragged into false and\n                          frivolous litigation by respondent No. 2, who is a habitual litigant. The\n                          petitioner further submits that the IDBI Bank has filed a Petition for\n                          initiating personal insolvency of the Petitioner under Section 95 of the\n                          Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Consequently, an Interim\n                          Moratorium has commenced under Section 96 of the Code. Once an\n                          Application under Section 95 IBC is filed, no legal actions or proceedings\n                          can be initiated or continued against the personal Guarantor for any debt.\n\n15.   Owing to the interim moratorium in effect, the Respondent No. 2 was\n                          unable to pursue or continue any civil proceedings against the Petitioner,\n\nincluding the said Civil Suit. The respondent No. 2 then resorted to the\n                          present vexatious Complaint, resulting in registration of the FIR. The\n                          petitioner has claimed that the entire Settlement amount in terms of the\n                          Settlement Deed stands paid to the Respondent No. 2. Any dispute\n                          specifically in regard to this Deed, is purely Civil in nature.\n\n16.   The petitioner has asserted that the allegations in the FIR include\n                          breach of trust, cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy, and criminal\n                          intimidation. It is alleged in the Complaint by respondent No.2 that the\n                          petitioner and his wife have committed multiple fraudulent activities and\n                          purportedly induced Respondent No. 2 to sign a settlement Agreement and\n                          addendum, promising a payment of Rs. 7 Crores. Allegedly, the Petitioner\n                          issued cheques that were dishonored due to insufficient funds, with no\n                          intention to honor the payment.\n\n17.   Further allegations are made in the Complaint that the petitioner and\n                          his wife intimidated and threatened respondent No.2 to prevent her from\n                          pursuing her legal action and coerced her into negotiating a reduction in the\n                          Settlement amount.\n\n18. It is stated in the Petition that the impugned FIR No.0126/2024 under\n                          Sections 420, 120B read with Section 34 against him and his present wife\n                          had been registered in compliance of the Order dated 28.05.2024 of the\n                          learned MM in Complaint Case bearing no. 2086/2024 titled as ‚ÄûGeeta\n                          Sachdev vs State of Delhi' filed by the Respondent No. 2, ex-wife of the\n                          petitioner. It is asserted that this Order has been obtained by suppressing\n                          second and final Addendum dated 11.03.2016 bearing Certification No.\n                          INDL254474609476750 e-stamped on 10.03.2016 at 6:48 which was\n                          executed between the Petitioner and the Respondent No. 2.\n\n19. It is claimed that her actions are driven by a desire to disrupt the\n                          Petitioner‚Äüs current marital happiness and to harass them. It is a retaliatory\n                          move, aimed at causing distress and disarray in the Petitioner‚Äüs well-\n                          established and content life, rather than to address any legitimate legal\n                          grievance.\n\n20.   It is claimed that the allegations in the Complaint pertain solely to the\n                          terms of the Settlement between the petitioner and the respondent No. 2 and\n                          non performance of the second Addendum. On these allegations, no criminal\n                          offences are made out. Hence, the petitioner has sought the quashing of the\n                          FIR. The petitioner has placed reliance on Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC\n                          India Limited and Others 2006 INSC 452, State of Haryana & Ors. Vs\n                          Bhajan Lal & Ors 1992 AIR 604, Vishnu Kumar Shukla & Anr. vs the State\n                          of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. Crl.Appeal No. 3618/2023, Sajjan Kumar v\n                          Central Bureau of Investigation (2010) 9 SCC 368, Vijay Kumar Ghai v.\n                          State of West Bengal 2022 SCC OnLine SC 344.\n\n21.   Learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 has argued that two second\n                          Addendums were signed on 11.03.2016. The petitioner fraudulently without\n                          the respondent No. 2 being aware presented a second Addendum signed on\n                          11.03.2016 while she was under the impression of the first Addendum of the\n                          same date being the full and final Settlement.\n\n22.    She has further contended that the petitioner was regularly sending\n                          her WhatsApp messages and giving the assurance that the balance amount\n                          under the first Addendum Settlement shall be paid by him and he did make\n                          certain payments to the Respondent No. 2, who remained under a bona fide\n                          belief that the petitioner shall be honoring the said Addendum. The copies of\n                          the various WhatsApp conversations have also been tendered which are\n\ntaken on record.\n\n23. It is vehemently argued on behalf of the respondent No.2 that there is no\n                          ground for quashing of the FIR.\n\n24.   Submissions heard.\n\n25.   The petitioner and the respondent No. 2 are the divorced spouses who\n                          had multiple matrimonial litigations which finally culminated into Divorce\n                          by Mutual Consent vide Final Decree dated 11.03.2016. During their long\n                          acrimonious litigation, the parties entered into three Settlement Deeds; first\n                          being 13.08.2015, in which the petitioner had agreed to give her Rs. 5 crores\n                          and two immovable properties. This Settlement was presented at the time of\n                          First Divorce Petition and was accepted by the parties in their respective\n                          Statements before the Family Court and is not under dispute.\n\n26. The other two Agreements dated 11.03.2016, are:\n\n(i) The first Addendum Agreement e-stamped at 6:46 PM\n                                according to which the petitioner was to give Rs. 10 crores along with\n                                two properties to the respondent No. 2, and\n\n(ii) The second Addendum dated 11.03.2016 e-stamped on 6:48\n                                PM, the respondent No. 2 was to get Rs. 3 crores along with two\n                                properties.\n\n27.   It is not in dispute that the second Addendum dated 11.03.2016 which\n                          provided for payment of Rs. 3 crores and two properties, was presented in\n                          the Court at the time of recording of Statements of the parties under the\n                          Petition for Divorce under Section 13(B) 2 of Hindu Marriage Act (HMA).\n\n28.   The certified copy of the Judgement under Section (B) 2 HMA\n                          specifically records that the parties have amicably resolved all their disputes.\n                          The contents of the Second Addendum Settlement providing for total\n\nSettlement amount of Rs. 3 crores with two properties was specifically\n                          recorded. It is further mentioned that in terms of the second Addendum, the\n                          wife had already received Rs. 1.5 crore from the husband as was mentioned\n                          in the Petition and the statements made by the parties in the Court. Out of\n                          the remaining 1.5 crore, a sum of Rs. 1.25 crores has been deposited by way\n                          of Bank Draft bearing No. 501589 dated 10.03.2016, drawn on ICICI Bank\n                          in favor of Respondent No. 2. The balance 25 lakhs were to be paid to\n                          respondent No.2 herein at the time of quashing of FIR No. 147/2011 under\n                          Sections 323/341/504 IPC before the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur\n                          Bench. The respondent No. 2 undertook to cooperate and ensure her\n                          presence for the quashing of the FIR.\n\n29. The said Judgment further records that the parties had agreed that the\n                          petitioner/husband shall be the sole and absolute exclusive owner of\n                          residential Apartment bearing No. 1625 B Magnolias, Gold Course Road,\n                          Gurugram from the said date and that the Respondent No. 2/wife had\n                          already executed the necessary documents and Application for deletion of\n                          her name with regard to the said property. The parties undertook to\n                          cooperate with each other for implementation of the said Agreement.\n\n30.   Moreover, it was recorded that the exclusive and absolute title of\n                          commercial property bearing No. WZ-1401/2 Nangal Raya, Delhi - 110046\n                          shall also be with the petitioner. Both the parties undertook to abide by the\n                          terms and conditions of the Settlement as was mentioned in their Petition\n                          and the MOU/Addendum dated 11.03.2016 exhibited as Ex. P5. After\n                          recording the Settlement, the divorce by Mutual Consent under Section\n                          13(B) 2 HMA, was granted.\n\n31.   It is evident that the terms of this Settlement were specifically\n\nreproduced and the documents exhibited. In fact,         there was a specific\n                          reference that the total cash amount agreed was Rs. 3 crores out of which\n                          Rs. 1.5 crores already stood paid while Rs. 1.25 crores were deposited to be\n                          released to the respondent No. 2, only after execution of the requisite title\n                          documents. Having made specific statements and exhibiting the Agreement\n                          as Ex. P-5, the respondent No. 2 cannot now either deny or challenge the\n                          Judgement which has never been challenged by respondent No. 2 till date.\n                          The contents of this Settlement, which were endorsed and accepted by the\n                          Parties before the Court, was duly acted upon and the Divorce was granted.\n                          The contention of the respondent No. 2 that she has been cheated or\n                          defrauded or was not aware that the second Addendum stamped at 6:48 PM\n                          was not presented before the family court is behest of any logic especially\n                          when the Order granting the Divorce repeated and affirmed the contents of\n                          the Settlement in detail.\n\n32.   There being specific reproduction and re affirmation by the parties of\n                          the terms of the Agreement, it cannot be said that she was misled or the\n                          terms of the Settlement were misrepresented to her. Therefore, it has to be\n                          held that this second Addendum dated 11.03.2006 signed by the Parties at\n                          the same time, signatures on which are not denied by her, was a binding\n                          Settlement.\n\n33.    The next question which arises is the validity of the first Addendum\n                          e-stamped at 6:46 PM on 11.03.2016. 27.       Apparently, it seems that the\n                          parties arrived at two Addendum Settlements each of which were\n                          independent; one for the purpose of taking divorce by Mutual Consent while\n                          the other was for Settlement of other disputes, claims in respect of money\n                          and properties. In any case, it is a question of interpretation of the intention\n\nof the parties, which they are at liberty to establish in the appropriate Civil\n                          Litigation. There is nothing to show that the second Addendum had\n                          superseded the first Addendum. This is further corroborated by the fact that\n                          the respondent No. 2 never sought repudiation of this Agreement, which was\n                          the basis of divorce by mutual consent.\n\n34.    Apparently, the two Addendums signed on 11.03.2016 were intended\n                          to be independent of each other; while the second Addendum became the\n                          basis for Divorce by Mutual Consent, the grievance against first addendum\n                          has been raised only in 2024 by filing a Complaint for registration of FIR.\n\n35. Pertinently, this second Addendum which became the basis of divorce by\n                          Mutual Consent does not find any mention in the FIR, which is purely\n                          confined to the first Addendum.\n\n36. It is evident that the entire grievance of the respondent No. 2 is in regard\n                          to the non compliance of the First Addendum Settlement dated 11.03.2016.\n                          The parties have voluntarily entered into it and whatever be the implications,\n                          they are essentially civil in nature. Breach of a Settlement would entail only\n                          civil liabilities; the essential ingredient of dishonest or fraudulent intention\n                          which are the foundation for an offence of Cheating or Breach of Trust, are\n                          essentially missing in the present FIR. Significantly, while the Addendum\n                          Agreement is of 2016, the Criminal Complaint alleging fraud and breach of\n                          Trust vis. a viz. this Agreement, has been filed only in 2024 i.e. after eight\n                          years of its execution, leading to registration of impugned FIR.\n\n37.   Consequently, the FIR No. 0126/2024 dated 31.05.2024 is hereby\n                          quashed along with all the proceedings emanating therefrom, leaving the\n                          parties to pursue their civil litigation and other litigation under Section 138\n                          NI Act, which have already been initiated.\n\n38.   It is hereby stated that observations made herein is for the purpose of\n                          the present petition and are not an expression on the merits of the Settlement\n                          Deeds.\n\n39.

Founded 26 years ago, Su-Kam was the first to manufacture power backup inverters, solving India's power crisis during the 1990s. Sachdev‚Äôs innovative inverters became household essentials, not just in India but also in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and parts of Africa.\n\nHowever, Su-Kam faced a downfall when it was declared bankrupt after defaulting on a Rs 240 crore loan. Although the company had assets to repay the loan, legal troubles arose, leading to its closure. Distributors and customers were left without service, and Sachdev‚Äôs reputation was severely affected.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sachdev did not give up. His wife, Khushboo, encouraged him to start a new venture. Together, they launched Su-vastika, providing services to customers and applying for patents on innovative products.\n\nSo far, six out of the 60 patents applied for have been granted. Sachdev continues to serve as a mentor, bringing his years of experience to the new company.\n\nSachdev‚Äôs journey from creating a revolutionary product to losing his company and rebuilding his career shows resilience.

His journey of carving success through humble beginnings is inspiring.\n\nKunwer was born to a railway clerk father in Punjab Bagh, Delhi. He used to sell pens on the street for his brother's pen business. That's how he funded his education.\n\nAfter graduation, Kunwer wanted to become a doctor and study medical, however due to financial setbacks he had to drop his dream and sell pens to make a small income.\n\nSevere power outages in the city inspired Kunwer to establish Su-Kam in 1998. Initially, he faced challenges, however, he innovated and built better price and quality inverters.\n\nSu-Kam became India's first and largest power company to sell internationally to markets like the Middle East, Bangladesh, and Nepal. It made it a global name.\n\nKunwer revolutionized 'Make in India' and also ventured into solar power. The company expanded its business, however some bad decisions led to its bankruptcy and clients leaving.\n\nSu-Kam was revived by Kunwer's wife,¬†Khushboo Sachdev, who founded Su-Vastika and gained support from clients and friends.

    "content": "The introduction of electricity transformed the way our lives for decades, but the growing numbers of shortages and their lengthening frequency made the power backup industry necessary. Su-Kam founder Kunwer Sachdev is the face of the power backup sector in India. The company is one of the most rapidly growing and progressive businesses in the country. Sachdev has been an inspiration to many who have proven that dreams do come true if we put in our dedication and hard work with the right energy.\n\nKunwer Sachdev was raised in the family of a railway clerk in Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh neighbourhood while dreaming of starting his own company one day.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, he started working in his brother‚Äôs pen business. Due to continuous power outrage, he quickly understood that there was a huge potential in the field of power backup. With the challenges of a severe power deficit, he decided to shut down his cable TV business and start Su-Kam in 1998.\n\nKunwer had a difficult time bringing investment for his business but it surprised him when clients returned his first 100 inverters due to some issues. He then improved them and made them better than the ones available in the market. After much research, he approached dealers and wholesalers. Even though the market was already crowded with various brands Su-kam‚Äôs inverters were unmatched in terms of price and quality.\n\nSu-Kam became the first company in the power industry which initiated exporting its products to the international markets.\n\nHe envisioned a Make in India campaign and his company to make a distinguished mark in the global market. He has also captured the markets in the Middle East, Bangladesh, Africa and Nepal where his products were valued for their quality and reliability.\n\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n\nKunwer expanded Su-Kam and made the brand widely known for its proficiency in the solar energy industry. However, due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Su-Kam went into bankruptcy. Its assets were also frozen. All the services were closed instantly. Due to this, dealers, distributors and customers suffered due to lack of services.\n\nAfter so many hurdles, his wife Khushboo Sachdev, came forward to help give services to the customers.  Khushboo Sachdev started a new venture Su-vastika under the mentorship of Kunwer Sachdev with the help of her friends and distributors. The company has been able to give several services to dealers, distributors and customers. Now, the company will be filing for over 60 patents with 6 under their name.\n\nLatest Blogs"

    "content": "Home\n\nMarket\n\nBT TV\n\nReels\n\nMenu\n\nBut, Kunwer Sachdev, the erstwhile cable guy, is not as comfortable as you would think. \"I am very excited about this new technology I discovered at the GITEX fair 2006. In business you have to constantly upgrade. If you want to move forward, you just can't stagnate.\" Sachdev would know. Creating a Rs 200- crore company from zilch with no formal training in engineering or management, is no mean achievement. He didn't even start with inverters, but cabling equipment. And it isn't as if lady luck really pursued him. It took Sachdev a patient 17 years to set up this enterprise which now has 20% equity stake from Reliance India Power Fund, a private equity fund sponsored jointly by Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Singapore-based Temasek Holdings.\n\nFor a graduate in statistics to a \"business technologist\" is surely an unusual leap. \"But business was always on my mind. All through college I thought of nothing else,\" confesses Sachdev. It may be that repeated failures of his father, a railway clerk, to start his own business, silently motivated the son to accomplish what his father couldn't. \"One lesson I learnt from my father's failure was that career and business don't go together. You have to sacrifice one for the other,\" says Sachdev. And failure has been the cornerstone of every success that he has known. During college, he helped his elder brother establish a business of pens. But they fell out, and Sachdev was on his own. The sales executive's job with a telecom company followed. In 1987 he married Gita, his junior at Delhi's Hindu College, amidst parental opposition. Sachdev moved to a rentedhouse. Gita's teaching job in a school came in handy.\n\nWhat Sachdev learnt about the telecom company stoked his business instincts. By 1989 he was ready to start a cable TV business with the help of a techie from the same company. An investment of Rs 10,000 was enough to get the system going. But while Sachdev quit his job, the techie refused, and for a while the father's story of failure became the son's. Sachdev did not give up hope.\n\nThe going became tougher as it was now a one-man-show- human resources, finance, technology et al. \"To get the work going I took up small assignments of cabling work for multi-storeyed buildings and hotels with two workers,\" says Sachdev, who managed these odd jobs with the advance payments from clients. Gita turned out to be his bedrock of support during the tough times. She would not only manage the house and their first-born but also slip a few notes of encouragement into Sachdev's pockets from time to time.\n\nWhen his friend left him, perhaps the biggest handicap was his complete ignorance of the technology field. So Sachdev decided to learn it on the job. Business and learning went together as he laboured on.The first taste of success came in 1991 when the business of cable TV witnessed a boom with the introduction of multi-channels. Each house needed cabling and Sachdev cashed in on this boom. He set up a small-scale unit with six people to manufacture amplifiers and directral couplers - all needed in the business of cablingunder the brand name Su-kam.\n\n\"The demand was huge, players were few and we were quality conscious. We would take back all faulty products thus reinforcing the faith of our customers,\" says Sachdev, who soon expanded his business by manufacturing dish antennas and satellite receivers. \"By 1997 our products were being sold in entire north India,\" says Sachdev. He had made his first million.\n\nIt seems that destiny finally decided to intervene and do a little jig of her own that would spell much bigger success. It was sometime in 1997 when Sachdev's home inverter conked off for the nth time. Frustrated, he decided to take it apart himself to identify the problem. What he saw was not a flawed product but immense business potential in giving the consumer something superior. Once the idea was born, Sachdev was quick to cash in on it. Intensive studies followed and using a new (Mosfet) technology he started manufacturing inverters at his factory.\n\nBut wait, even here destiny did not play it straight. The products were a disaster and all 100 of them were returned by the buyers. Not to be bogged down by yet another failure, Sachdev got a few people from the fledgling UPS industry and focused on technological innovation. He manufactured inverters using a more advanced technology testing and retesting them for failures. The capacity was just enough to manufacture 100 inverters a month but the response for the refined inverters was stupendous. In the unorganised market, his products stood out.\n\nIn 2000, Sachdev took the decision to close down his profitable business of cable TV products and set up his first big factory in Gurgaon at a cost of Rs 15 lakh. His quest to continuously upgrade his products using new technologies made him a clear market leader. A validation of his success came when heavyweights Reliance and Temasek paid Rs 45 crore for a 20% stake in the company. Sachdev is now looking at other futuristic areas such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems, hybrid systems and inverters of over 100 kva capacity. A Rs 80-crore factory to manufacture SMF batteries will be operational in April 2007.\n\nTime to go public? Maybe, he says. For a man, who took up a few insurance policies only because the agents were persistent, matters of personal finance do not rank rather high on his priority table. \"I would rather re-invest in business than purchase property, look up the stock market or mutual funds,\" he says. Perhaps a house in Gurgaon, a farmhouse, 21 offices, three factories and 1,000 employees, are enough for Sachdev to be unconcerned with personal finance.\n\nFor more case studies of employees turned employers, log on towww.moneytoday.inand click onE2E\n\nCopyright ¬©2025Living Media India Limited.

Kunwar Sachdev is one such example of achieving his goal. The saying \"one thought changes your entire life\" is often heard but rarely demonstrated. Kunwar Sachdev, for example, used to make a little money by selling pens door to door. One day, however, he had an idea and decided to invest some money to launch a successful business that is now operating not just in India but also in many other countries.\n\nGrowing up in the family of a railway clerk, Kunwer Sachdev is a dreamer who has become a great inspiration in India's power backup industry. His path, characterized by inventiveness and perseverance, demonstrates the transforming potential of commitment. Kunwar had raised the money for his education by going door-to-door to sell pens. He had given up on his dream of becoming a doctor since he could not get medical admission.\n\nWhile working in marketing for a cable company after graduating, Kunwar Sachdev learned that the industry has a lot of room to grow and that not all challenges must be overcome from the start. He just quit his job and founded Su-Kam Communication, which subsequently concentrated solely on producing solar-related products.\n\nThe company owned by Kunwar Sachdev manufactures a variety of solar products that are in high demand in India and abroad. Kunwar Sachdev reportedly owns businesses worth Rs 2300 crore.\n\nNot Virat Kohli!

    "content": "Guide to UAE Corporate Tax Return filing (3rd Live Batch)\n\nOnline Excel Course\n\nAI Advantage: Mastering ITR 2025 Compliance\n\nCertification Course on GST Notices Reply from AI Tools\n\nExcel Mastery Program\n\nCertification Course on Practical Filing of Income Tax Returns\n\nAs everyone is \r\n\t\t\t\taware that Su-Kam is in inverter business but we do lot of other \r\n\t\t\t\tbusinesses like solar business, battery business and inverter business. \r\n\t\t\t\tSu-Kam was found in 1992, and initially we started with the cable \r\n\t\t\t\tTV business and then in 1998 we moved into the inverter business, \r\n\t\t\t\tthat is power business and since then we have been continuously \r\n\t\t\t\tgrowing into this power field only. So we are slowly, slowly getting \r\n\t\t\t\tinto a power solutions company rather than an inverter company or \r\n\t\t\t\ta UPS company so we are trying to build a whole system around the \r\n\t\t\t\tpower back up solutions that is why we call ourselves as a power \r\n\t\t\t\tsolutions company and as far as fancy name is concerned, I think \r\n\t\t\t\tI was in college then I thought of this name and it was not for \r\n\t\t\t\tan inverter or for cable TV it was for pens that√¢¬Ä¬ôs how name came \r\n\t\t\t\tinto the system.\n\nI would not call \r\n\t\t\t\tit a garage, I got a shop and I started from there. Definitely at \r\n\t\t\t\tone time my parents had a home where on the top of it I created \r\n\t\t\t\ta small garage for manufacturing also. So definitely you can say \r\n\t\t\t\tthat.\n\nJourney has been \r\n\t\t\t\tvery exciting and good because there was always a change happening \r\n\t\t\t\tand we were developing products, developing markets, developing \r\n\t\t\t\tbranding and learning throughout these career and I think learning \r\n\t\t\t\twas very high. I am very fortunate that I came to this position \r\n\t\t\t\tand I think the kind of learnings I had in life were very exciting \r\n\t\t\t\tand challenging.\n\nI do not understand \r\n\t\t\t\tthat how this happened. Actually I was already in manufacturing \r\n\t\t\t\tbusiness, I was manufacturing Cable TV equipments so one day I opened \r\n\t\t\t\tmy inverter at home and I realized this inverter was not a real \r\n\t\t\t\tgood product, it was troubling me at home and since I was into a \r\n\t\t\t\tmanufacturing business I thought I can make it better that√¢¬Ä¬ôs how \r\n\t\t\t\tI thought of manufacturing inverter but I was already a manufacturer \r\n\t\t\t\tof electronics making cable TV products.\n\nI think it√¢¬Ä¬ôs \r\n\t\t\t\tan interesting thing that I am not from the technology background \r\n\t\t\t\tbecause it helps as I have no boundaries. People who learn that \r\n\t\t\t\tone plus one is equal to two and two plus three is equal to five \r\n\t\t\t\tthey know this is the only thing they can think of and since I do \r\n\t\t\t\tnot know what is one plus one and what is two plus three so my imagination \r\n\t\t\t\tcan go to any direction so that is one thing where I think creativity \r\n\t\t\t\thas no boundaries. When you are not technical so your creativity \r\n\t\t\t\tcan go to left right and center and sometimes it is good and sometimes \r\n\t\t\t\tit is bad. Because sometimes when I go with some ideas to my R&D \r\n\t\t\t\tguys they tell me sir you should learn technical things first then \r\n\t\t\t\tI do learn but I think it helps. Secondly I think if you go to any \r\n\t\t\t\tfield whether it is politics, films or anywhere people who have \r\n\t\t\t\tgot very successful they were not from those fields so I do not \r\n\t\t\t\tsee any field where people have to, have that education to make \r\n\t\t\t\tit successful so this it√¢¬Ä¬ôs all passion, interest and your learning \r\n\t\t\t\twhich helps you.\n\nWe love being \r\n\t\t\t\tthere and we honor it and motivation for success is AKC, motivation \r\n\t\t\t\tfor being ethical is AKC. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs our pride. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs the landmark Dr \r\n\t\t\t\tChauhan has put for us, and at no cost during our breathing tenure \r\n\t\t\t\ton the planet we can let the flag go down because of anything which \r\n\t\t\t\tpoints a bad figure towards AKC.\n\nI think the major \r\n\t\t\t\tshift which has taken place in the last 20 years which I feel is \r\n\t\t\t\tthat earlier people used to think that the businessman is a √¢¬Ä¬úchor√¢¬Ä¬ù \r\n\t\t\t\tso any businessman having any enterprise people always used to think \r\n\t\t\t\tthat he is a √¢¬Ä¬úchor√¢¬Ä¬ù or businessman is not honest, entrepreneurs \r\n\t\t\t\tare not honest and I see in these 20 years that thing has changed. \r\n\t\t\t\tPeople who are in government sector they are preparing their kids \r\n\t\t\t\tto join the private sector rather than a government sector so I \r\n\t\t\t\tthink this is the major shift where the thought process of people \r\n\t\t\t\thave changed and middle class or upper class people want their kids \r\n\t\t\t\tto join the private sector. In last 5 years I have seen that lot \r\n\t\t\t\tof people want to hear the entrepreneurs and next decade I think \r\n\t\t\t\tbelongs to entrepreneurs.\n\nWhen we were \r\n\t\t\t\tdoing this R&D research and we were already made lot of technologies \r\n\t\t\t\tlike Sine wave technology, big inverters, lot of charging technology \r\n\t\t\t\twe stumbled upon and we did not know that these are the technologies \r\n\t\t\t\twhich are not made across the globe so we started exporting, we \r\n\t\t\t\tstarted going out then we realized that we have really developed \r\n\t\t\t\tcertain technologies which are not developed by the other companies \r\n\t\t\t\tand the technologies which we develop were advanced compared to \r\n\t\t\t\tthose companies which were dealing in the industry. So we started \r\n\t\t\t\tfiling for patents and we filed the first patent in 2004 which we \r\n\t\t\t\tgot that time. Our engineers did not have the time and they did \r\n\t\t\t\tnot know how to file a patent, so in 2007 we became serious and \r\n\t\t\t\toutsourced the patent services then we realized that our company \r\n\t\t\t\tis sitting on lot of technologies so we need to bring everything \r\n\t\t\t\ton papers, so we started working very aggressively on this and nowadays \r\n\t\t\t\twe are filing almost 2 technology patents in a month so we have \r\n\t\t\t\tfiled more than 60 technology patents so far and almost few patents \r\n\t\t\t\tare in process that we are going to get. When I am talking about \r\n\t\t\t\t60 technology patents all are published so they are final patents \r\n\t\t\t\tthat we have filed so I think the list is growing.\n\nWe are working \r\n\t\t\t\ton lot of technologies like Solar, power, stabilization and power \r\n\t\t\t\tmonitoring so basically we want to save the power whether it is \r\n\t\t\t\ta home, office, factory or complex we would like to save the power \r\n\t\t\t\twhether it is the power generated by the diesel, gensets or it is \r\n\t\t\t\tgenerated by any other source. So we would like to save the power \r\n\t\t\t\tbecause I think in India the power wastage is very high so we are \r\n\t\t\t\tworking on those technologies and in India solar has lot of challenges \r\n\t\t\t\tbecause government wants to give subsidy to the solar industry but \r\n\t\t\t\tgovernment faces lot of challenges in terms of technologies. So \r\n\t\t\t\twe are working on lot of technologies where we are bringing up with \r\n\t\t\t\tthe new concept in inverters, where government can also watch what \r\n\t\t\t\tkind of generation we are doing, one house can easily integrate \r\n\t\t\t\tthose systems at home or their offices or in the factories. Also \r\n\t\t\t\twe are working on LED√¢¬Ä¬ôs; improving the battery technologies because \r\n\t\t\t\tstorage is a big business worldwide storage is going to be a very \r\n\t\t\t\tbig business.\n\nThat√¢¬Ä¬ôs a very \r\n\t\t\t\tinteresting subject. We created R&D in 2001 in fact we started doing \r\n\t\t\t\tR&D in 1990 itself but formally we got the R&D certificate from \r\n\t\t\t\tgovernment of India in 2001-2002. We have a very strong R&D where \r\n\t\t\t\twe have more than 40 people working. It is one of its kinds in India \r\n\t\t\t\twhere I think we have all the equipment, testing equipments, we \r\n\t\t\t\thave all the certifications in place and as we are working on lot \r\n\t\t\t\tof new technologies so R&D is the backbone of the country.\n\nWe have 10,000 \r\n\t\t\t\tsquare feet area, 40 people are working there and we do not have \r\n\t\t\t\tany fixed budget for R&D, we just invest whatever is required for \r\n\t\t\t\tthe R&D.\n\nOur products \r\n\t\t\t\tare changing from time to time so right now there is a power shortage \r\n\t\t\t\tso we are into inverters which we are making, they are used by household \r\n\t\t\t\tapplications may be 5-7 years down the line that application is \r\n\t\t\t\tnot there because power scenario is changing in India. So we are \r\n\t\t\t\tbringing in lot of new technology products where you can do the \r\n\t\t\t\tstorage or save the power, store the power or we can use the power \r\n\t\t\t\tas and when required or we can get the power from the solar or wind. \r\n\t\t\t\tSo renewable we are working on, so I think in the coming times the \r\n\t\t\t\tsame technology will go ahead I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think so, that is why we need \r\n\t\t\t\tlot of changes to use this technology in some other areas. Like \r\n\t\t\t\tinverters are used in fuels, solar and various applications so we \r\n\t\t\t\tare working in lot other applications where we can use the same \r\n\t\t\t\ttechnologies with the minor changes. The same inverter technology \r\n\t\t\t\tis used in UPS also. So this is a very interesting area where we \r\n\t\t\t\tcan explore more even when the power distribution is taking place. \r\n\t\t\t\tWe can play a major role there in the transformation, where there \r\n\t\t\t\tare transformers they are reducing the voltage there also we can \r\n\t\t\t\tplay a major role. I think in the coming years technology needs \r\n\t\t\t\tchange which is a constant change which is happening and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs a \r\n\t\t\t\tneed of an hour.\n\nActually in the \r\n\t\t\t\tyear 2004 when we sent our first consignment to Sri Lanka there \r\n\t\t\t\twas some power problem going on and somebody called us who knew \r\n\t\t\t\tus. We sent few inverters to Sri Lanka and the moment we started \r\n\t\t\t\twith Sri Lanka we started exploring other countries, we made a small \r\n\t\t\t\tteam and people who never travelled abroad they were the part of \r\n\t\t\t\tthat team. I myself travelled initially then we started with Bangladesh, \r\n\t\t\t\tNigeria Uganda, Kenya, Middle East slowly, slowly we also learnt \r\n\t\t\t\tthat there are countries facing the similar problems so we started \r\n\t\t\t\texports in a very small way and today our exports are more than \r\n\t\t\t\t100 crores. There are 70 countries we are covering and there are \r\n\t\t\t\tmore countries we need to cover. Even in the existing countries \r\n\t\t\t\twe need to expand, there are many challenges in terms of servicing, \r\n\t\t\t\tsupport structure so we are expanding. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a new industry we just \r\n\t\t\t\tcame as an export because what we did it was followed by others. \r\n\t\t\t\tIf you see India is the world leader in this technology, it is the \r\n\t\t\t\tbiggest exporter in this Industry.\n\nRight now Government \r\n\t\t\t\thas not taken it as a serious area, it does not think that this \r\n\t\t\t\tindustry can be a 5000 crore export industry and I can see it very \r\n\t\t\t\tclearly that we can be a 5000 crore industry for exports. There \r\n\t\t\t\tis a lot government can do, just recognizing that we are the leaders \r\n\t\t\t\tin some areas like exports of software√¢¬Ä¬ôs or hardware√¢¬Ä¬ôs so if the \r\n\t\t\t\tgovernment can give us some more incentives that would help us. \r\n\t\t\t\tAlso other than incentives even our embassies can help us which \r\n\t\t\t\tis right now is not there, like in other countries embassies are \r\n\t\t\t\tvery aggressive as far as helping these industries are concerned. \r\n\t\t\t\tIn India that concept is picking up but not with the speed that \r\n\t\t\t\twe are looking at, so government can help us in many ways. Government \r\n\t\t\t\tis definitely improving, lots of restrictions aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt there which \r\n\t\t\t\twere there before.\n\nYes you are right, \r\n\t\t\t\tbut that is not in my preview since I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know how government \r\n\t\t\t\tworks. It has its own speed and challenges. So what I can do is \r\n\t\t\t\twhatever is under my preview so I cannot comment that government \r\n\t\t\t\tis slow.\n\nWe have seen \r\n\t\t\t\tthe down times when the world market crashed, Indian market crashed \r\n\t\t\t\tand I think in any company you need to evolve. You need to change \r\n\t\t\t\twith the time so we understand that you need to evolve, products \r\n\t\t\t\tneed to evolved, Industry as a whole need to be evolved and as a \r\n\t\t\t\thuman being you need to be evolved first. So this is a very continuous \r\n\t\t\t\tphenomenon and we are working towards it and I think when you say \r\n\t\t\t\tresilient towards any conditions so you need to keep changing, keep \r\n\t\t\t\timproving, keep listening, keep understanding the situation rather \r\n\t\t\t\tthan thinking that you have reached somewhere. In Su-Kam we have \r\n\t\t\t\ta very learning culture and we want this to be maintained and we \r\n\t\t\t\tstrive for that and I hope that it will remain the same in coming \r\n\t\t\t\ttough times too.\n\nWe went to Nepal \r\n\t\t\t\tbecause Nepal government had put a ban and we had almost 80% share \r\n\t\t\t\tin Nepal so they had put a ban on import of the inverters so we \r\n\t\t\t\thad no choice but to put up a factory in Nepal in collaboration \r\n\t\t\t\twith one of the distributor there. As far as India is concerned \r\n\t\t\t\twe have 6 locations where we have our factories. We went to Baddi \r\n\t\t\t\tHimachal where government was giving us subsidies on Income Tax \r\n\t\t\t\tand Excise so that was the reason we went to Baddi. I think if the \r\n\t\t\t\torganization is big then having different locations is always good \r\n\t\t\t\tbecause there could be some problems which could arise like strikes, \r\n\t\t\t\tworkers strikes, transport strikes so definitely different facilities \r\n\t\t\t\tare always good in such situations.\n\nWe are expanding \r\n\t\t\t\tin storage business like batteries so we are trying to bring automobile \r\n\t\t\t\tbatteries we are always working hard and Mr. Ganguly who was the \r\n\t\t\t\tchairman of the site he joined our board. Also we are working on \r\n\t\t\t\tlot of new technologies inverter, UPS and automobile because in \r\n\t\t\t\tthe automobile front there are only 2 companies in India right now. \r\n\t\t\t\tThere is lot need to be done in that area. So battery area is improving \r\n\t\t\t\tlike anything then solar is a big challenge. We are working on the \r\n\t\t\t\tsolar and we are going to expand in a solar business where we will \r\n\t\t\t\tbe putting off grid and on grid systems. So expansion plans are \r\n\t\t\t\tdefinitely there.\n\nAs you said it√¢¬Ä¬ôs \r\n\t\t\t\ta big so I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have to talk about competition, actually I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt \r\n\t\t\t\tlook at the competitors since in our industry we are the ones who \r\n\t\t\t\talways bringing in the technologies so in fact whenever I opened \r\n\t\t\t\tany product 1 - 2 years back I did not find anything worthwhile. \r\n\t\t\t\tSo I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt waste time what competitors are doing and my focus is \r\n\t\t\t\talways on what we need to do, how we are doing it and how can we \r\n\t\t\t\timprove.\n\nI think the whole \r\n\t\t\t\tindustry will be impacted if government would increase the limit \r\n\t\t\t\tfor Income Tax if that is uplifted say 3-3.5 lakhs lot of salaried \r\n\t\t\t\tpeople will get lot of money in their hands to spend. So whatever \r\n\t\t\t\tmoney that we definitely come into the system rather than going \r\n\t\t\t\tto government that√¢¬Ä¬ôs a big chunk. Lot of people will into get, who \r\n\t\t\t\tare not paying tax they will also start paying tax to the government \r\n\t\t\t\tso it√¢¬Ä¬ôs a very good move if government is going to upgrade the list. \r\n\t\t\t\tAs far as other things are concerned I think government is reducing \r\n\t\t\t\tthe CRR ratio which they have already done, 5 days back they reduced \r\n\t\t\t\tthe CRR, lot of lucrative banks are also coming. So I think government \r\n\t\t\t\tneed to further reduce the CRR ratio, so the money should come into \r\n\t\t\t\tthe system. Government is trying to spend money from their home \r\n\t\t\t\tcompanies, public sector companies and rest government has hardly \r\n\t\t\t\tany choice.\n\nI would like \r\n\t\t\t\tto mention that UPS industry is controlled by Chinese manufacturers \r\n\t\t\t\tor other foreign multinationals, it is because there is no duty \r\n\t\t\t\ton the UPS so I would request to the government to relook at the \r\n\t\t\t\tpicture. UPS industry should have some sort of restrictions because \r\n\t\t\t\tUPS as a whole with the batteries is coming without any taxation \r\n\t\t\t\tin India and when we are manufacturing we have to give some duties \r\n\t\t\t\tand when you have a finished product there is no duty. This has \r\n\t\t\t\thit Indian market in a big way so I think government need to relook \r\n\t\t\t\tat the situation so that Indian companies can come at the competitive \r\n\t\t\t\tlevel.\n\nI think nowadays \r\n\t\t\t\teverybody wants to become rich even in our times we wanted to become \r\n\t\t\t\trich and famous. This is the general tendency among everyone. But \r\n\t\t\t\tI feel you should have the focus, nobody knows what he or she can \r\n\t\t\t\tdo, even I did not know that I would come to this stage. So you \r\n\t\t\t\thave to find out that what is the area which interests you and that \r\n\t\t\t\tis only possible when you start working rather than talking or sitting \r\n\t\t\t\tor thinking one should start working and then you do the best in \r\n\t\t\t\tthat job because you never know when somebody will come and see \r\n\t\t\t\tyou working there and he will pick you from there so you have to \r\n\t\t\t\tperform the best whatever you are doing not thinking that no I am \r\n\t\t\t\tnot made for this or I am not cut for this whatever chance you get \r\n\t\t\t\tto perform you should perform the best because you never know that \r\n\t\t\t\twould lead you to somewhere else. I will give you an example, somebody \r\n\t\t\t\tis coming to my home and washing my car and I see him performing \r\n\t\t\t\this duty very well and I know he is a great guy, he washes my car \r\n\t\t\t\tproperly and he is a hardworking guy, may be tomorrow I will take \r\n\t\t\t\tthat guy and put him somewhere else which I have done in the past. \r\n\t\t\t\tSo nobody knows who will end up where, so first thing is to start \r\n\t\t\t\tworking whatever comes to their hand so slowly, slowly opportunities \r\n\t\t\t\twould start opening up. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs not that god is going to come to your \r\n\t\t\t\tplace and would knock and say that we have an opportunity for you. \r\n\t\t\t\tSo opportunities are lying everywhere so you start doing something \r\n\t\t\t\twhether you are paid less or more you should start working and then \r\n\t\t\t\tyou start getting your directions rather than waiting what is my \r\n\t\t\t\tinterest area. Some people I meet, they say that we are still looking \r\n\t\t\t\twhat interest us the most then I ask them that are you doing something? \r\n\t\t\t\tThey say No, then I say how will you come to know that what interests \r\n\t\t\t\tyou unless you start working. So I think the only message I will \r\n\t\t\t\tgive you is that no work is small or big, there is no industry which \r\n\t\t\t\tis small or big, there is no industry where you can say you can√¢¬Ä¬ôt \r\n\t\t\t\tmake money or you can make money. So you start working and that \r\n\t\t\t\twill lead you to your interest area and try to do the best what \r\n\t\t\t\tyou are doing, what you are giving to your work. So you should try \r\n\t\t\t\tyour best, that√¢¬Ä¬ôs all I want to say.\n\nIndia's largest network forfinance professionals\n\nAlternatively, you can log in using:"

    "content": "Saturday | Jun 28 2025 |\n\nIn the last five years or so, the solar industry has grown rapidly in India, and continues to grow, given the targets of the government for 2022 and 2030. In an exclusive interview with BW Businessworld, Kunwer Sachdev, Founder and MD of Su-Kam, discusses the solar industry, the economics behind it, technology and the government targets for the solar industry. Edited excerpts:\n\nWhy do the economics of renewable energy favour the rise of solar power?\n\nAs the demand for electricity increases having access to low-cost power supply is paramount. The yearly rise of electricity tariff as opposed to the plummeting price of solar is one of the main reasons fuelling the growth of solar power. What is drawing people towards solar energy is that it is a great way to save money. Although the initial cost of setting up a solar system is high but the money is easily recovered as the user starts producing electricity significantly reducing dependence on conventional electricity. With huge reduction in the electricity bill, the user starts saving from day one, enabling him to recover the ROI within just a few years‚Äô time. Moreover, since the average life of a solar system is 20-25 years, the user not only makes savings but is also protected from unpredictable electricity prices in the future. Moreover, solar energy has great environmental benefits; creating electricity from solar energy negates the emission of harmful greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. That is where renewable energy comes into the picture as it is the only alternative to clean and cheap source of electricity. As the storage system is making huge technological advancements, solar system is becoming even more viable.\n\nCan the targets of 2022 by the government, to add 175 GW of renewable energy be achieved?\n\nThis target can be achieved only if more and more establishments and households go solar. For this, the government should provide subsidy by local state electricity board on generation instead on the installation of a solar system. Though subsidies are available, the government needs to make it more easily accessible and encourage people to use it.\n\nWhat are the obstacles for the rise of the solar industry?\n\nSolar industry has the potential of becoming very big in India. The country is blessed with ample sunshine throughout the year. Solar industry is set to boom only if more and more establishments and households go solar. At the moment, the government rooftop policy is a very flawed one. The whole process is very cumbersome for the common man. Although the net-metering policy is in place, lack of adequate financial incentives acts as an impediment. It may take 3-4 months from the date of application to receiving a grant of connectivity even for a residential rooftop solar system. There are further shared approvals and clearances between multiple departments such as the regulatory commission, state nodal agencies, discoms, urban local bodies, etc, which may cause delays. The process of obtaining clearances should be made easy, clear and hassle-free.\n\nAnother major obstacle that the solar industry is facing is the non-availability of skilled and trained manpower. Solar companies like us have taken matters into our own hands by imparting training to employees in-house.\n\nSub-standard Chinese products flooding the Indian market is also posing a threat to the industry as these products are available at 10-20% cheaper price.\n\nHow is technology changing the trend of solar power?\n\nTechnology is bringing about a paradigm shift in the solar industry. The industry is making great strides in terms of technology, they are constantly working on new technologies and products within the solar space to offer innovative solutions to Institutional, industrial, corporate and home consumers. At Su-Kam, for instance, all our products leverage the Internet of Things along with Artificial Intelligence and can be controlled even through the mobile phone. We‚Äôve introduced innovative products like Hybrid Solar System that can work as both off-grid and on-grid system. Another revolutionary product we‚Äôve built is Brainy S, a solar UPS that can run all kinds of sensitive appliances. This brilliant product combines the features of Online UPS and Solar Power Conditioning Unit to give reliable and steady power to your computers, modems, servers and other sensitive appliances. Our Solar Conversion Kit which is based on DSP technology can be connected with any existing HUPS/inverter and convert it into a solar hybrid powered system. It‚Äôs built -in artificial intelligence gives preference to solar power over main supply to either charge the batteries or to run the connected load, hence utilizing the solar power generated optimally. Vast improvement in solar technology is enabling us to reap the maximum benefit of solar energy while making it extremely user friendly. As we‚Äôre making huge advancement in storage technology smaller residential systems of 1 Kw to 5 Kw Solar system is going to see a huge boom in the future. Even smaller systems of 100W to 500W will be in demand as there is less space so people can put a single panel and generate electricity with it.\n\nHow is the inverter segment of Su-Kam integrating sustainability into their practice?\n\nInverter still has a lot of demand in India and it will remain like this for many more years to come. The power situation in India is a political issue rather than a power availability issue. Every government that has come and gone has promised the same thing. The irony is that there is already 24 x7 electricity in India, we have surplus electricity, the only thing that‚Äôs stopping us from getting electricity is because power plants are not working to their full capacity due to political issues. As the world is turning to renewable sources of energy like solar, many people do not realise that the same inverter technology is used in the normal inverter and solar inverter. The only thing that has to be done is replace the battery in a regular inverter with a solar- powered one. Inverter converts DC electricity stored in the battery into AC electricity to run appliances. The same thing happens in solar power; since sun produces DC electricity, the inverter converts it into usable AC electricity. With only a small tweaking, a normal inverter works as a solar inverter. Su-Kam is the pioneer of inverter technology so it is not very difficult for us to make minor changes in our inverters to convert it into a solar inverter.\n\nWhat does the future of renewable energy look like?\n\nThe falling cost of solar energy in the last five years along with the falling price of solar panels, due to technology advances, is making solar even more viable. As solar is making great progress now, the government needs to provide a special push to increase installations of rooftop solar. As battery technology improves and the cost of storage drops rapidly, solar energy has a bright future.\n\npartner@businessworld.in\n\n+91 981-8063-325\n\nDPT 805, DLF prime tower, Okhla Industrial Area, Okhla, New Delhi\n\n¬© Copyright BW BUSINESSWORLD 2025.

    "content": "New Delhi: Seven years ago, Geeta Sachdev was livid when her husband Kunwer splurged most of their Rs25 lakh savings on a 20GHz spectrum analyser. They had been looking for a house to buy at the time.\n\nKunwer Sachdev laughs at the memory today. ‚ÄúYou know how wives are.‚Äù\n\nEnsconced in a mansion in Gurgaon along with their two sons, he can afford to be sanguine about the 2002 expense. After all, Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, the power backup specialist company that he started in 1998, has grown into an enterprise that expects Rs500 crore in revenue in the year to March.\n\nSachdev lounges casually in his Gurgaon office in a T-shirt and bermudas on a Monday afternoon.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve taken a sabbatical from day-to-day operations, which in any case are on auto-pilot,‚Äù he says. The hiatus from 16-hour workdays was also prompted by health concerns that surfaced about a year and a half ago, prompting him to bring in a professional at the helm of affairs‚Äîchief executive officer Venkat Rajaraman.\n\nIt‚Äôs not as if he‚Äôs whiling away his time in the office. Sachdev is indulging his passion for history by reading up on Stalin, Mao and even Hitler, playing squash, learning to play the piano and putting finishing touches to Su-Bake, a forthcoming patisserie venture which is still in the laboratory stage.\n\nThe young company caught the fancy of large investors in December 2005, with Reliance Capital Ltd and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore‚Äôs government-owned investment company, together picking up an 18% stake in Su-Kam for Rs45 crore. The public will get a chance to own a piece of the business, with Sachdev planning an initial public offering sometime next year.\n\nFor the fiscal year, the company expects to achieve an output of one million inverters. Export revenues, too, are expected to see a 25% rise to Rs100 crore this year from Rs80 crore in 2008-09.\n\nSu-Kam has moved beyond its bread-and-butter business of inverters for domestic use. The share of revenues from power backups for homes has been steadily declining in any case. It will drop to 40% this year from 55% last fiscal, while industrial inverters and exports will make up 30% each, compared with 20% and 25%, respectively, for the same period.\n\nThe product range also includes solar-based backup systems, power storage facilities and LED (light-emitting diode) lighting.\n\n‚ÄúWe have started three pilot projects in solar-powered LED lighting‚Äîin Nepal, Nigeria and Malaysia,‚Äù says Sachdev. Power storage devices were a natural corollary, he adds, as the company readies for its entry into automotive batteries in the current fiscal.\n\nA self-admitted straggler during his academic years, Sachdev started off his career by assisting his brother in the business of selling pens, which took off well enough for his elder sibling to open a shop in Old Delhi‚Äôs Nai Sadak area. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt satisfied with just retailing other brands. I wanted to create a brand of my own while my brother was more conservative who didn‚Äôt want to lose a good thing,‚Äù he recounts. The name Su-Kam was coined during a college canteen chat with friends.\n\nAfter Sachdev opted out of the family business to branch out on his own, he dabbled in various commercial pursuits, including with a law firm and a cable TV equipment manufacturing company. The latter eventually led to his moment of epiphany in 1992 when he established his own business manufacturing dish antennae, amplifiers and splitters.\n\n‚ÄúTowards the end of the 1990s, locally assembled inverters had appeared on the scene,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn fact, I had purchased one for my home for which I needed the services of a local mechanic almost on a daily basis.‚Äù\n\nExasperated, he took matters into his own hands, buoyed by his expertise in the electronics equipment industry.\n\nThe void that he saw on peering into his inverter convinced him that there was a crying need for a branded product in the inverter segment that was largely unorganized.\n\n‚ÄúBy that time, I had made money from my cable TV business and so, with a seed capital of Rs10,000, I set up my first inverter manufacturing unit,‚Äù Sachdev recalls.\n\nThe strategy was simple‚Äîtake a look at all the inverters in the market and design his own. That was the time when his Rs22 lakh spectrum analyser, which measures and analyses electrical waves, came in handy.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt a smooth ride though; quality issues kept cropping up whenever the company came out with a new product.\n\n‚ÄúThe first year, we sold 100 units,‚Äù he says. Product innovation, he says, was crucial to constantly up the ante against the competition. ‚ÄúWe have filed for more than 50 technology patents so far,‚Äù he points out.\n\nToday, with six plants running to capacity‚Äîfour in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, and two in Gurgaon on the outskirts of New Delhi‚ÄîSu-Kam‚Äôs client list includes Tata Teleservices Ltd and Vodafone Essar Ltd, which use its inverters as power backups for their cellphone towers, besides the Bharti group‚Äôs EasyDay outlets in Jagadhari near Ambala in Haryana, and Dwarka and Pitampura in New Delhi.\n\nCatch all theCorporate newsand Updates on Live Mint.

    "content": "‚ÄúSu-Kam, the company that revolutionized the power backup Industry, what happened to it? What happened to the founder: Mr Kunwer Sachdev?‚Äù\n\nWell, the founder of Su-Kam, Mr.Kunwer Sachdev Is now back as the mentor of the technology-driven power solution company Su-vastika Solar. Kunwer Sachdev is ready to shake up the energy sector in India with more sustainable and green power storage solutions.\n\nWho is Kunwer Sachdev?\n\nMr. Kunwer Sachdev is the Founder of One of the most well-known brands in the Power Back-up Industry ‚Äì Su-Kam Power Systems Limited. Kunwer is an entrepreneur, marketer, innovator, motivational speaker, thinker, and leader. He revolutionized the power back up the sector in India with his innovative and user-friendly products that made Indian inverters a household name not just in his home country but also in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asian countries such as, Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\nHis valuable contributions to the inverter/UPS and solar sector have earned him titles such as ‚ÄòThe Inverter Man of India‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Solar man of India‚Äô.\n\nThe Story starts in 1990\n\nIn the 1990s when India was grappling with electricity problems, Mr. Kunwer Sachdev was quick to analyze the unorganized market in the power backup industry, which was in complete disarray at the time with substandard products and local players dominating the market. He was instrumental in transforming the power backup industry into an organized sector by training his team, hiring professionals to organize the products and systems, and creating a service setup that was spread all across India, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHe always goes by the mantra ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe decisions are not right or wrong. It‚Äôs the outcome of those decisions which are right or wrong.‚Äù That is why he always makes decisions considering them to be the important parameter to succeed in life. He was able to see the possibilities in even the most mundane things in life and find innovative ways of making them useful to mankind.\n\nA life full of achievements.\n\nMost of the breakthrough innovations you see in the power backup sector are his brainchild. He invented the world‚Äôs first plastic-body inverter which was adjudged as ‚ÄòInnovation of the Decade‚Äô by India Today. He even introduced world-class technologies such as MOSFET, Microcontrollers based, and DSP Sine Wave into inverters. He also gave ‚ÄòHome UPS‚Äô to India, which combined the features of UPS and an inverter into a single piece of equipment. Always looking for avenues to up his game and create better technology, he introduced World‚Äôs first touch-screen UPS, which is Bluetooth enabled so that users can monitor it from their phones. He created the first 100 KVA inverter in 2005 when nobody used to believe it, and he made a truck with a 100 KVA inverter and it used to travel all across India to showcase the Indian technology called Power on wheels. He also created the service network having service vans moving all across India to give door-to-door service.\n\nIn his own words ‚ÄúI envisioned the ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô company to make an indelible mark in the global market, and so did when in 2003 my company became the first in India to export power electronic products to foreign markets. This was no small feat. It was the first time that I toured various countries with hospitable and inhospitable environments, and faced many issues since there was no precedence from the industry. The civil situation in many African nations was unstable, still, I persevered on to make a mark for my products and my country.‚Äù\n\nAnd what a journey it was. He swept the international markets in the Middle East, Africa, Bangladesh and Nepal where my products are loved for their quality and reliability ‚Äî so much so that Chinese and American products are completely ousted from these markets. Even today Indian inverters and UPS are preferred over Chinese ‚Äì a huge credit goes to his efforts and of course his team. The products built by Mr. Sachdev outsmart many others due to their easy handling and ruggedness. His products do not need any artificial environment like air conditioning, they can work from sub-zero to 55-degree centigrade.\n\nAn unfortunate break in progress.\n\nSomehow due to Mr. Kunwer Sachdev‚Äôs personal problems at home, his beloved company Su-Kam went into bankruptcy and the banks filed legal cases against him which was a big challenge for him to handle.\n\nEspecially because the money owed to the banks and the assets owned by the company were sufficient to pay back the loan amount. However, due to the mishandling of the banks the company was closed down by the financial institutions and all the services of customers were also closed down overnight. He was under depression for quite some time as the strong brand that he built over the last 32 years of his career went away with a single stroke. He was slapped one case after another by the banks as they wanted to save their skin and they had no interest in saving either company nor an entrepreneur who revolutionized the power sector in India. His beloved brand Su-kam was taken from him. A brand that he built alone by traveling to each and every corner of India, from big metropolitan cities to small cities and towns. He educated so many people like a true teacher, spreading awareness to every nook and corner of India. He successfully competed against the big players of China and Europe, instilling faith in the Indian power storage sector that they are no less than any other foreign competitors but he was not able to save his own brand from being taken from him.\n\nIn the words of Mr. Kunwer Sachdev ‚ÄúAll the reputation that I built for the brand Su-kam went for a sudden toss without any fault of mine. What pained me immensely was seeing my distributors, dealers and customers being left in a lurch by banks. Stakeholders were unable to get the same quality service that Su-kam was famous for providing, putting them in a state of shock and disbelief. Dealers and distributors were unable to honor the warranties, while the materials were left lying with them, unsold, tying up their resources. No matter how hard I tried, I was not able to come for their aid, as all the assets of the company and properties belonging to the company were under the control of these financial institutions.¬† I desperately wanted to help them but my hands were tied in legal issues. That is when my wife came out to help with the idea of Su-vastika.‚Äù\n\nAbout Su-Vastika\n\nThe comeback and becoming the first Indian to file technology patents in Inverter UPS and solar field.\n\nAfter a lot of help from friends and distributors and employees, Mr. Kunwer Sachdev‚Äôs wife Khushbhoo Sachdev started this new venture Su-vastika and since then the company has been able to give a lot of services and help to the employees, dealers and distributors.\n\nKunwer is working as a mentor for Suvastika and started developing world-class, cutting-edge products backed with the latest technological innovations. Some of the breakthrough solutions Mr. Kunwer has developed for Su-vastika include Energy Storage Systems, Lifts/Escalators Backup, Online UPS with Galvanic Solution, Tubular Battery, VRLA Battery, Lithium Battery solutions, EV Chargers, Automatic Testing Setup and many more.\n\nToday, Su-vastika is constantly building new technologies and filing patents, especially in the field of Lithium batteries, Emergency Rescue devices for lifts.\n\nWith the speed at which his team and Mr. Sachdev were building new technologies, he knew he had to do something to protect them. Thus, he started filing patents and in doing so became the first Indian entrepreneur to file for technology and design patents in the Indian power backup Industry. His company made a record for being the only company in the power backup industry to file over 60 patents with nearly 2 technology patents filed in a month. He is continuously coming up with newer patent ideas and not just in the inverter industry but in many other fields related to energy, artificial intelligence, communications and many more.\n\nFuture is bright for the Inverter Man of India.\n\nMr. Kunwer Sachdev‚Äôs strong business acumen and foresightedness helped him to gauge the vast opportunities in the solar sector and he immersed himself in it. He started working passionately in building world-class solar products and developed some unique solar products that suit the needs of everyone from a small house in a remote village to big industries. Today, his dream is to see every household in India getting powered by solar energy. He wants every business, big or small, to invest in solar energy and reap the seamless benefits of this natural resource.\n\n\n\nYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked*\n\nComment*\n\nName*\n\nEmail*\n\nWebsite\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nŒî\n\nLogin to your account below\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember Me\n\n\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\n\n\n\n\n¬© 2024 APN NEWS, All Rights Reserved."

    "content": "Home¬ªEV+Storage¬ªThe New Battery Technologies and Opportunities\n\nBy Kunwer Sachdev\n\nWith the immediate and critical need to move to alternative sources of energy worldwide, battery technology is being explored massively. As an alternative, it can support the de-carbonization of the transportation sector. It can evolve from the current lithium-ion battery to the succeeding generation to all-solid-state batteries. It will bring an improved energy density, safety, battery lifespan, and a definite cost reduction. The recent growth in the battery market has led to further improvements in technology and numerous options too. Battery manufacturers are constantly experimenting to create products that are cost-effective, lighter, and extra powerful.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick look at the new-age battery technologies that are the next big step in the transformation of energy:\n\nLithium batteries\n\nKunwer Sachdev ‚Äì Entrepreneur and Innovator, Founder ‚Äì Su Kam Power Systems\n\nOne of the most popular batteries that are at the heart of nearly every electric vehicle. Owing to their high energy per unit mass relative to other electrical energy storage systems. These also offer high energy efficiency, good high-temperature performance, a very long lifetime, cycling performance, and low self-discharge. Most elements of Lithium batteries can be recycled therefore, the advanced version of the lithium batteries is expected to be deployed before the first generation of solid-state batteries. It will be ideal for applications such as being the energy storage system for renewable and transportation.\n\nIt must be pointed out that for any kind of battery testing to be done, we need a minimum experience of a decade, which the Lithium variants have crossed therefore, the next battery with Lithium will be much more acceptable.\n\nLithium-Sulfur batteries\n\nMade of Sulfur and metallic lithium, these batteries make an energy density that is four times lithium-ion batteries ‚Äì¬† a perfect product used in aviation due to its long life and high energy. These are as good as solid-state lithium-ion batteries because of their superior gravimetric energy density. As the technology is relatively new, at the prototype stage, no major drawbacks have been noted yet. Lithium-sulpur batteries are lighter and cheaper, and possibly the next generation of power cells that we could be used in EVs. Lithium-Sulfur batteries can store more energy than a battery using current lithium technology.\n\nSolid-State batteries\n\nThe Solid-state battery is revolutionary in itself. It will be the shining armor for the EVs, as it reduces the cost of the batteries and make living with a plug-in car just like an internal combustion engine (ICE), only better. I feel Solid-state batteries will be the future and a game-changer for EVs. These batteries promise fast charging and a running range of the car without recharging is good enough to elude the ICE cars on the fast lane of highways and the long-distance race to the summer sun. The solid-state batteries are potentially safer, with higher energy densities. Also, with the cells getting smaller, the vehicle gets lightweight and can accommodate more people. Solid-state batteries bring down the cost-per-kilowatt-hour, which is expected to speed up the adoption ofbattery electric vehiclesin the coming days. Solid-state batteries are likely to be used widely in battery EVs from the next decade. This will be a revolutionary shift.\n\nWith the advancements in technology, there are many innovations that we will all get to experience like ‚Äì the NanoBolt Lithium Tungsten batteries, Zinc-Manganese Oxide batteries, Organosilicon electrolyte batteries, Gold nanowire gel electrolyte batteries to name a few.\n\nNanoBolt Lithium Tungstenbatteries give a layered structure that offers more surface area for ion transfer. The layers of nanotubes and different elements create a web structure inside of the battery that works with high efficiency. One of the advantages is the faster transfer of energy across the batteries. It also allows for the batteries to hold a greater charge than other designs ‚Äì definitely, the technology of the future, as the multi-layered nanotubes can be cut to work in any size oflithium-ion battery.\n\nZinc-manganese oxide batteriesalready exist in the market but very soon we will have rechargeable ones. They are easy to use, much safer, and will work best for large power networks.\n\nOrganosilicon electrolyte batteriesare an improved version of Lithium-ion batteries. Organosilicon electrolyte solvent stabilizes the elements involved in the electron and ion transfer inside the battery. An efficient and safer option to use, this type might also be used effectively in solid-state electrolyte batteries, combining the advantages of both technologies.\n\nAs gels are not as combustible as liquids, Gold nanowires were covered with Manganese-Dioxide, then covered with electrolyte gel. The gel interacts with the metal oxide coating to prevent it from corrosion.¬† The electrode is tested up to 200,000 times within a three-month time frame. The findings reveal that they did not detect any loss of nano-cell capacity, nor was there any breakage. Hence, Gold nanowire gel electrolyte batteries are a good option.\n\nWith so much on the anvil and so much already available, I am optimistic that there will be further innovations and the world will adopt clean, cost-effective, and environment-conscious power solutions to reduce carbon footprint.\n\nThe author, Kunwer Sachdev is a veteran industry expert, and founder of Sukam, among other firms.\n\nWe are India's leading B2B media house, reporting full-time on solar energy, wind, battery storage, solar inverters, and electric vehicle (EV) charging.

I took up any and all types of projects from people. There was one such project that I could not complete on time. It was for a hotel and seeing that I could not deliver, the owner locked me in a room. I stayed put in the room for two hours until he opened the door and asked for his advance money back. But since I had spent that in buying the equipment, I told him to keep my bike instead should I fail to deliver. Eventually I did complete the job and he was happy. Now he is a very dear friend of mine,\" recalls Sachdev.\n\nThey say entrepreneurs are not taught, they are born and perhaps Kunwer Sachdev is one person who perfectly fits this theory. Additionally, as any entrepreneur would testify, failure is not only an important ingredient but also a very important aspect in any successful venture.\n\n\"When I started making invertors in 1997, we experimented with new technologies. We didn't have any idea what we were doing and we kept borrowing components from different products. Money doesn't matter in any entrepreneurship, I started with only Rs 10,000. There were a lot of negatives in the beginning. I remember going to a bank for a loan of Rs 5,000, and they took so much time that I said forget it. From that day I didn't go to banks, I have raised funds in my own way,\" says Sachdev.\n\nEarly this year, the $200 million Reliance India Power Fund, picked up a 20 per cent stake in Su-Kam in a Rs 45 crore (Rs 450 million) deal. Su-Kam has already made inroads into world markets such as Asia, Africa, Middle East and the Pacific Region and is now looking to make a strategic US acquisition.\n\n\"We are looking to acquire a company in the US in the next one year. I haven't seen any company that we might want to acquire yet, but the acquisition will be complete in a year. Deadlines are very important for me,\" says Sachdev.\n\nSachdev is confident of scaling up his operations in India as well. \"We will keep on scaling up. My balance sheet for the last 6 years shows more than 100 per cent growth in each year. It has been a challenge for me to sustain that year after year. This year we installed invertors on all major cell sites across the country, and we have a big order from Reliance Infocomm.\n\nWe are in talks with Bharti and other telecom players. Next year, I plan to do Rs 1,000 crore (Rs 10 billion) business, and I can see that happening,\" concludes Sachdev.\n\nFor more on management, log on towww.moneycontrol.com\n\nThe 10 Best Universities In The World\n\nRD Burman's Top 13 Songs\n\nPaneer Bhurji Roll: 10-Min Recipe\n\nNEWS\n\nBUSINESS\n\nMOVIES\n\nCRICKET\n\nSPORTS\n\nGET AHEAD"

Hurun has been in China for the last 20 years and we have seen how the Chinese entrepreneurs have grown and come of age. We do see a similar pattern in India. So, this award is really about how we are going to achieve that kind of growth story in India. By identifying the patterns in China, we look at those entrepreneurs in India who have contributed in a similar fashion.‚Äù\n\n\n\nHailing from a lower middle-class family background, Sachdev never let financial constraints bar him from becoming a serial entrepreneur. He started off by selling pens on cycle with his older brother at a tender age of 15 years. He later founded a profitable business of cable TV communications in Delhi.\n\n\n\nBeing a visionary, Kunwer was quick to foresee the growth of power backup industry in India and decided to shut down his cable TV business in 1998 to establish Su-Kam Power Systems which is headquartered in Gurgaon.\n\n\n\nSachdev is credited with catapulting Su-Kam to the top league of companies in its category within a short span of a few years. Once a startup, Su-Kam, is now an Indian Multinational Corporation, and is recognized as one of the fastest growing organization among the India Inc. 500.\n\n\n\nToday Su-Kam manufactures more than 250 products including various solar products, UPS, batteries, and customized solar solutions. A successful example of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, Su-Kam has over 75,000 channel partners in many countries around the world. Sachdev has been instrumental in expanding company‚Äôs operations to almost 90 countries worldwide and capturing the power market in Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nNewsVoir is India's leading news distribution platform.
